"Back again with a new spiral. On Friday I started getting an unrelenting overall headache not a migraine but persistent. Some nausea that eventually turned into stabby pains in my stomach. I can‚Äôt take Advil due to stomach issues. Tylenol would help take the pain away then wear off. Same time my next is super stiff. I used a posture corrector last week and I think it messed up my neck. Muscles feel like rocks. So I borrow my friends neck massager, tried some stretches and got an actual neck massage today. It really helped my headache however my stomach is now having this ‚Äúdropping‚Äù feeling - you know that feeling when you peer over the edge of a cliff or almost get side swiped on a highway? It‚Äôs like my flight or fight system is activated. I‚Äôm worried my neck is trapping my vagus nerve. Is this possible? Am I going to be okay?

"Hi! Thank you for your detailed and helpful reply. I actually am familiar with Dr. Horowitz, SA, and used one of his papers and the UK guidelines during my own taper but still likely did it too fast. I had the sort of naive ‚Äòthat couldn‚Äôt happen to me‚Äô attitude and here we are. *sigh*. I didn‚Äôt put it in this post but I did reinstate a few weeks ago at 0.4 mg and have had slight improvement since (able to sleep at night, don‚Äôt have a headache 100% of the time though I get them pretty much daily). I have been contemplating increasing more but honestly am so terrified to do anything or make any changes due to all I‚Äôve been through. I work nights and haven‚Äôt been able to sleep during the day because my anxiety seems to surge more during the daytime so I am really feeling quite stuck because I‚Äôm not going to be able to sustain essentially pulling 3 all nighters per week for much longer and it certainly isn‚Äôt helping my mental health to do so. I find forums like Reddit and SA pretty triggering due to all of the bad stories so I‚Äôve been trying to avoid them. At this point 8 wouldn‚Äôt even mind being back on celexa if I could get my life back. I miss my old self so much. As far as migraine medication goes nurtec is relatively new but I haven‚Äôt noticed it affecting my anxiety as of yet. Triptans definitely heighten it so I try to avoid those. I‚Äôm off caffeine and avoid OTC meds due to rebound headaches.

The animals come to the top of the stairs to check on her but she screams at them to stay up there so they don't make a mess in the blood. I have a chocolate lab who will absolutely follow this for all of about an hour if there's been a spill or glass on the floor. But maybe she's semi conscious and repeating it frequently. The pants falling down, the random doors and palm prints, all that random unexplainable evidence could be explained but the fact that she was very high basically until blood loss cause it's own kind of delirium.

">Cylcobenraprene Presuming you meant Cyclobenzaprine, because that's what I am prescribed and have been on for years. This is not a headache / migraine treatment or preventative exactly. It is a muscle relaxant. That may not be suitable or relevant for a lot of people with migraine. In my case it sort of looks like: Injury > neurological damage > muscle spasms / knots (and insomnia) > migraines. In other words, for me, treating the muscle spasms(with meds and basically not working/laboring to incurr more muscle problems) reduces migraine frequency and severity. The side effect of drowsiness can be pretty severe, especially if I take at full prescription(3x daily, 10mg I think), but that's perfect, because I also have insomnia and getting tired a lot helps me get enough sleep. In cases where I still get a 10/10, I have ""the big pill"" Fioricet, I think (bottles always say ""butalbital"", which is also listed as an ingredient, so there's a weird circular thing when you try to look it up....but anyways) >Fioricet capsules contain a combination of acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine. Acetaminophen is a pain reliever and fever reducer. Butalbital is in a group of drugs called barbiturates. It relaxes muscle contractions involved in a tension headache. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It relaxes muscle contractions in blood vessels to improve blood flow. This usually cracks the bad ones, though it can take a few hours. Possibly because they basically have to be taken with food or they tear my stomach up really bad, I think it eats right through the lining when empty. I only ever take one, I took two once, as per ""every 4 hours as needed""....never again, stomach pain for days. There are variations with aspirin instead of tylenol, and apparently even some with codeine. Never had those. A 4-way attack on the tension and migraine headache might be nice, but eh, when you ask too hard about this stuff you run the risk of looking like a drug seeker. At that, I have a scrip for like 15 of ""the big pills"" which, if I'm lucky, I fill once every 6 months because the rest keep me out of the range where there're necessary.

"Okay, so they were texting constantly, all of a sudden the line disconnects during their call right after him hearing the dog whining and somehow he was not worried sick? How van you go from being in constant contact to zero calls/texts without being super worried. He thought she was with her family but somehow doesn't double check with any of her family members? My humble opinion is that it could be a stranger coming in through the backdoor, pushing her down the stairs (do we now if anything got stolen?) and roaming around for a little bit, leaving her downstairs waiting for them to be gone. I don't know what type of medication she was on for her migraine but maybe some of it could have had something blood thinning in it making it so her bleeding did not stop.

"Quick background: I'm 36M, had TBI when I was 8 years old. I can't go out without atlius tinted contact lenses, tinted glasses, clip-on sunglasses, and a hat, whether it's day or night. Botox seems to be the only thing that works for me, but after 3 years, it only works for about a month and a half. The other month and a half, I'm on average 2 or 3 out of 10, I can go a week without leaving the house, and I can't even go to my mailbox. I've tried numerous products that might help, and I'd say about 95% of them were failures. My wife told me about a product she saw on Instagram called ZOK Instant Migraine Relief. I hesitated to try it because most of these are posted to get a free product, and they sure don't post the negative ones. However, I decided to give it a try. I experienced great relief when I applied negative pressure to my left ear. It made me wonder if it could be related to vertigo, as neurologists never mentioned it. So, last week looked into the vertigo Epley maneuver., I went from being miserable 2/10 to 8/10 in just 4 minutes, and I had a fantastic day, which is not something I'm accustomed to. I kept doing it for the next few days, about 4-5 times a day, and half somersault maneuver, every time it gave me 1 hour or 2 of relief, which was great, but after that I went back to the dizziness; I kept doing the manoeuvers until yesterday I barely saw a difference, today too, the relief was still there but minimal. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing here.

"I have gotten migraines regularly for many years, but TMS is a noticeable trigger of them for me ‚Äì I think the coil is so close to the trigeminal nerve that it can trigger one by stimulating the nerve, and also by causing repetitive twitching of head/facial muscles which causes muscle tension which is another cause of migraines (at least for me). I‚Äôve noticed for myself that if the TMS session is more painful, it‚Äôs more likely to trigger a migraine - so like other people have said, it‚Äôs worth asking your technician to try a different angle of the coil. It‚Äôs also common that TMS is really painful for the first few sessions, but the pain diminishes with time, so maybe it will stop triggering migraines after the first week or two. If your migraines persist it‚Äôs also worth getting an abortive medication from your PCP - if you‚Äôre new to migraines they will probably start you off with a triptan (which is a class of migraine medication that you take when you have a migraine - it doesn‚Äôt prevent them).

"This was a fear of mine as well. I avoided trying any new products close to the wedding (make up/perfume/hairspray), I did not put my hair up (so no pins/hair tension to worry about), we had our wedding be a Sunday brunch rather than evening wedding (so no loud music or flashy lights, minimal alcohol, etc), I wore a supportive dress that did not require a weird bra or anything that would put too much stress on my shoulders, and I had my emergency kit with my abortive, excedrin migraine, electrolyte powder, ginger chews, salonpas patches, etc. I was very fortunate that I had a migraine-free (and chronic-pain free!) day. I also put a good amount of conscious effort into taking good care of myself for the week leading up to the wedding, and trying not to let myself spend too much time sitting and letting the anxiety build about whether Id have a migraine (or be able to walk properly, due to my other chronic issues lol). I drank lots of water, went to bed early, and was ready to take my abortives at the *slightest* sign a migraine was coming on. I was not going to play my usual (stupid) ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù game. Whether or not you get a migraine is in the (rather long) list of things that we just cannot control. Be prepared, but try not to ruminate on the negative what-ifs too much. The day will be how it will be. And at the end of the day you‚Äôll be married! Congratulations to you and your partner!

"I‚Äôve read through your comments about the different meds and treatments you‚Äôve tried. I don‚Äôt say this to offend you, so please don‚Äôt take it that way. It sounds like you‚Äôre not being given enough time on any one med or combo to actually give them a chance to do anything. I know that can be infuriating to hear, it still pisses me off when my doctor says to ‚Äúgive it time‚Äù when I‚Äôm in the thick of an attack. But trust me, it‚Äôs true. For me, Botox has been a godsend. That said, treatment is typically done every 12 weeks and it becomes more and more effective each treatment. They say to allow for 3 treatments (so 9 months) for it to take full effect. I‚Äôm currently experiencing my first major attack (triggered by recent surgery) in about 7 months thanks to the Botox. I also get SPG blocks done at each treatment which are AMAZING and my doctor sends home the remaining solution as a nasal spray to use between office procedures. Triptans usually are advised against with this type of complex migraine, so it‚Äôs no surprise you‚Äôve not had much luck there. If you look up triptans w/ hemiplegic migraine there‚Äôs tons of reading material to go into detail. I‚Äôve gone thru several different meds and med combos over the last few years since my dx (took about 2 years of near constant aura to get a proper dx). Each med my neurologist had me try for at least 2-3 months before deciding unless I experienced severe side effects. We found that verapamil 360 mg works as a great starting off point for me. It worked on its own for about 6-8 months before it started to feel like it wasn‚Äôt quite enough. Instead of taking me off of the verapamil, we added topiramate which I loved - it was a great combo! Unfortunately, it contributes to kidney stones which I already am prone to so I had to stop taking it after about 9 months. I‚Äôve since started propranolol in addition to the verapamil which seems to be working well along with the Botox and spg block. For abortive meds, I take Benadryl and try to sleep at the first sign of aura. If that doesn‚Äôt do the trick after a few nights I‚Äôll start a high dose prednisone taper which usually does the trick. There are downsides to taking steroids frequently though, so my dr just ordered ubrelvy for me to try. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet as the approval process took forever, but it gets here tomorrow so we‚Äôll see. Sorry this was so long! Keep in mind what works for one might not work for you, but hopefully from all of the responses here you‚Äôll at least have some good talking points to take to your doctors.

"I‚Äôm only going to comment on filling prescriptions and coverage of special treatments (with our health insurance company). You can choose any pharmacy you want and once you show them your health insurance card, you don‚Äôt typically pay anything on the spot. The pharmacy will bill your insurance company and you‚Äôll get a bill for your costs later. Also, ‚Äùfilling‚Äù prescriptions is not as painful as in the US. I had to visit a pharmacy in San Jose a couple of times and I couldn‚Äôt believe how inefficient it was. Here you show up with a prescription and more often than not you‚Äôre out of there with your meds in less than 5 minutes. No one is counting pills and putting them in a bottle. Almost everything is pre-packaged. Many doctors and health centers also have a little pharmacy on site and you can get your (basic) meds during your doc visit without having to go to a ‚Äùreal‚Äù pharmacy separately. That‚Äôs so much more convenient especially with sick kids. For more special treatments, the doctors typically know what‚Äôs always covered and if they need to make a case for the insurance. As an examply, one of my family members used a really expensive biological migraine medication for a while. That‚Äôs not covered until a certain regulated amount of other treatments has been tried. Once that was done, the neurologist did the application and the insurance sent us a written decision by mail. So we knew it will be covered and could order it to the local pharmacy.

"I was 7 when diagnosed but looking back I was showing signs up to a year prior. My parents said that I was losing a lot of weight, drinking a lot of water, peeing a lot, low energy, not eating/snacking a lot. The week or so leading up to my diagnosis I had the swine flu (2009) so I was out of school, had the above symptoms, constant migraine, sleeping all day, as the week went on the got progressively weaker. By the time I was brought to the ER I was super pale and non-responsive (my family said I looked like I was dead), the doctor immediately smelt my breath (DKA has a fruity smell) and my sugar was in the high 900s and immediately sent for me to be transferred to a children‚Äôs hospital (more things happened after).

"When I have a really bad headache or migraine I will usually do all of the following: - I will have some sort of caffeine while I take some meds for the pain or an abortive medication for migraines. - Take a hot shower in the dark - Apply Icyhot to my temples since they get painful and it is a good distraction from the pain. Also works for the back of the neck. - Use my Renpho eye massager. It seems to help quite a bit with eye pain especially since it has a heating element. I know some people won't put it over their eyes and have it just massage the forehead. - Use my IceBeanie that I keep in the fridge since the way it is designed it is too cold in the freezer for me. - I will usually try to eat spicy foods, and/or icecream to help distract and numb the pain. My go to food if I'm not totally knocked out from pain is a double cheeseburger, fries, large Dr. Pepper from McDonald's üòÇ - If all else fails I just try sleeping in the dark with meditation music. Eventually I fall asleep for a few hours and feel a bit better after.

"i warn this is long because my health is WEIRD so this problem has a lot of necessary context. i have an arachnoid cyst that gave me severe chronic migraine as a child as it grew- however, it went dormant and i stopped having migraines when i was 11, so i never got it taken out (surgery was too risky when it could end up returning, since it wasnt causing issues anymore). at 22 i began having migraines again, 16-17 a month and had to leave my job because it was too debilitating. the doctor that did my new 2023 brain scans said that the cyst hadnt grown and so it wasnt causing them. i read the reports, i have a neuroscience degree and i dont think they expected me to understand them lol, but it DID grow about a cm, i guess just not enough for the doctor to worry‚Ä¶ either way, i went to a neurologist, was put on propranolol and suddenly went down to less than 1 migraine a month on average, it was amazing. about two or three months ago my insurance told me they would only cover one specific pharmacy and i had to transfer all my perscriptions from kroger pharmacy to the new one (carelon). the pills from this pharmacy look different, so i know they have a different provider for their generics‚Ä¶ and i also know that generics from different providers can have slightly different makeups. yay. i quickly noticed that both my metformin and my propranolol worked less efficiently with this new pharmacy, even when my metformin dose was raised. ive had more acne breakouts and have been exhausted all the time, two signs that my PCOS is not being controlled. i began having 4 or so migraines a month. i plan on discussing this with my neurologist in two weeks to see if she can get me put back to the old brand of generics. tldr: med brands switched by insurance a few months ago, dont work as well. i went to a concert last tuesday (as i write this it is 7 days after) and got a migraine, which i half expected because of how many flashing lights it had and the noise levels. no regrets, concert was amazing. the issue is that the day after, i got another migraine. two in a row these days is weird for me. had another concert thursday, third day with a migraine.. yesterday was the sixth day in a row. they always hit in the evening, like they did before i was medicated. i feel like my meds arent working at all all of a sudden. i can still work for now because they hit after work, but i wake up with postdrome and overall feel awful most of the time. at first, i thought my famotidine stopped working (for my GERD) because i lost my voice on thursday night until monday evening, which happens if i stop taking my famotidine. but i didnt stop. a cough developed over the weekend with mucus, so i guess it was a head cold i caught at the concert? my colestipol ALSO suddenly isnt working right, my diarrhea from post-cholesectomy syndrome has been uncontrollable this week. as of today, my famotidine is working again(?) but my colestipol and propranolol arent. i know that cold meds can mess with propranolol, but i only took one dose of dayquil on monday, and outside of that i had some cough drops across the weekend. but the daily migraines started before i began taking them- and if the concerts were the migraine cause, why am i still getting them a week later, with consistent predictable timing just like my unmedicated migraines? another note is that i have a new aura with these migraines: i get a mild acid/bile headache, like what i used to get before i had my gallbladder removed in 2021. these migraines have weird symptoms as well. my face gets very hot as if i have a fever, but i dont, and it feels normal to anyone who touches me. sometimes i turn red in the face. the rest of my usual symptoms are present- the light sensitivity is horrid, pain is not the worst migraine ive had but still debilitating, dizziness, nausea, blurry vision, sometimes confusion/disorientation. i was ANA tested a few years ago and it was negative, so as far as i know it isnt lupus, but i dont think i was tested during a ‚Äòflare‚Äô. lupus has been on my radar of possibility for a while now because i have blood family with it. and i work for a rheumatology clinic so i see lupus info a lot lol i know developed drug resistence is the likely answer, but the weird timing makes me think something else was involved im curious if anyone has any information about what might be going on here because i can‚Äôt find any relevant drug interactions or anything about a head cold making meds stop working. i am in contact with my neurologist and have an appointment in two weeks, but im not sure if she‚Äôd have an explanation. my gastroenterologist is on leave and her CNA isn‚Äôt much help. health background: 23F, 255lbs 5‚Äô9‚Äù. on 60mg propranolol hcl er, 40mg famotidine, 2gm colestipol hcl, 1500mg metformin hcl xr daily. i follow all of my meds instructions and space them out throughout the day per doc‚Äôs orders because i know colestipol can ‚Äòturn off‚Äô other meds if taken too close. i have had no major changes in my life or medicine routine recently besides the pharmacy change and do not miss doses outside of 1-3 times a week missing a colestipol because it doesn‚Äôt fit in my schedule. likely relevant conditions: GERD, insulin resistant PCOS, post-cholesectomy syndrome, and chronic migraine with aura. likely irrelevant conditions: raynauds syndrome, nonalc fatty liver, born premature",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I've been suffering from headaches for just under 2 years now. With no warning signs I simply woke up one day with a headache that refused to go away, didn't respond to any over the counter medication, and waxed and waned but never disappeared. Now it's been 2 years and I still haven't been able to go longer than 24 hours without a headache attack of some kind. I went to a doctor after 5 months of daily headaches, he ordered an MRI and labs that all came back normal and prescribed Fioricet. When the Fioricet didn't touch the pain, the medication journey began and I've since tried over the counters, vitamin supplements, sumatriptan, metoprolol, prednisone, Ajovy, Nurtec, diet changes, Daith piercings, magnesium, and more. Nothing has reduced my headache days or relieved any pain. I'm starting to worry nothing will ever work :/ My headaches have never behaved like typical migraines, which makes me worry they won't respond to migraine treatment. They're really more one long headache that waxes and wanes all day every day from low to mid level pain, not really your typical attack like people describe. No aura, pro drome, or post drome, and the pain isn't as intense as a lot of migraine sufferers describe, but it is constant. I do occasionally get light or sound sensitivity when the pain is worse however. Sorry for the bit of a long rambling post. I know 2 years and my number of treatments really isn't that long or that many in the migraine world üòÖ I guess i'm just looking for some reassurance from the more experienced migraine-ers that just because nothing has worked so far doesn't mean nothing ever will, because it's starting to feel that way. Especially because my new neurologist was incredibly confident the most recent combination would work, and still no effect. So many people praise the anti-CGRPs as miracle drugs, if Ajovy didn't work at all for me does that mean I'm out of luck with all the CGRP inhibitors? Or is there a chance another brand could still work? Regardless, thank you to anyone who read through this, it's nice to know there are other people who have gone through this same song and dance. And if not no worries! Here's the TLDR: should I start preparing for being just generally treatment resistant and accept I may not find a medication for me if 2 yrs of treatments have all failed with no impact on my headaches?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"So, for my wedding, I planned a VERY casual day. We had a beach wedding only a couple hours from home. Friends and family came and stayed together at a big house. I scheduled my wedding for the late afternoon so there was NO rushing or stress. I HIGHLY recommend doing a low key, casual wedding. I wasn't stressed in the slightest. So, that helped. Some other things that I think made a difference: -I'm going to say this again: LOW stress. -I stuck to my regular sleep schedule as much as possible. -I made sure to eat all week before, stay hydrated, and keep gatorade around in case I needed something extra. -Pre-take Advil/Tylenol (if you aren't planning on drinking). I also took an abortive triptan just in case. -Is there a time of year where your migraines are worse due to weather? Perhaps don't schedule in those months.

"Badly... üòÖ In all honesty, I am currently working through this myself at the moment, and it's tough. The biggest hurdle for me was managing the stress migraine itself brings. Worrying about it ruining events, or it happening at bad times, or being upset when I do get a migraine. It's been a long process, and I'm not there yet, but I feel I am finally starting to accept migraine as part of my life and trying to take it in my stride. This is with a lot of meditation, self care and therapy. General stress for me is easier to manage. I have been getting help for my anxiety and suspected ADHD and realising that a lot of my stress can be managed in a healthier way. I think being undiagnosed with anxiety and likely ADHD for so long meant I couldn't address it or get help, but now I am accessing support I am noticing small improvements. It's really freeing to feel less stressed. One big takeaway for me is to rationalise everything. Why bother stressing about something you have no control over, or something that has happened?

"The following is how I helped my wife go from daily migraines to a few times a month... Red Lights If you have light sensitive migraines and have to be in a dark room, you may find using a red light allows you to see without causing light sensitive problems. Sleep and meal times. These are most often underrated factors in migraines. A good circadian rhythm is important for ALL areas of health. - Aim for 7 to 9 hours - Go to bed, wake up and have your main meals the same time each day (or at least within half hour of the same time). Even weekends Hydration Dehydration causes headaches and migraines Blood Sugar Buy a blood sugar monitor, they are very cheap. Diet and Supplements Suppliments - Magnesium: Start with 400-600mg/day. - Riboflavin (Vitamin B2): 400mg/day. - Keto or Carnivore Diet Avoid - Sugar: This includes white pasta, rice, bread. - MSG: Known migraine trigger. - Ultra processed food - Any food ingredient that looks like a scientific name or that you need to Google to see what it is. Stress Management - Mindfulness/Meditation:** Use apps like Waking Up or Headspace to manage stress. - A daily walk for at least half hour outside, preferably close to nature (park, field etc). Walking bar foot on grass for a few minutes really helps me. Medications - Triptans (Rizatriptan, Sumatriptan):** Use at migraine onset, no more than 3 times/week to avoid rebound headaches. - OTC Painkillers (Ibuprofen, Paracetamol):** Limit to avoid rebound headaches. Keep a Food, mood and symptom Diary A detailed diary will greatly help you to find migraine triggers. The best way is to use a spreadsheet I used the following columns: Date, Time, Food (list all ingredients), blood sugar level, Mood, Headache pain (1-10), Additional symptoms (aura, nausea, light sensitivity). Use an AI to Analyse the diary If possible use am AI like GPT or Gemini to analyse the diary. They are better at finding triggers we easily miss such as two foods combined causing migraines or triggers that cause migraines the following day. Upload the spreadsheet diary to the AI and ask the it to analyse the diary to find migraine triggers.

"The main advantage of ER treatment is IVs. If you don't respond to toradol shots, a toradol IV can still work (some people don't have luck with the shots), and there are other meds they can add as well. So, if you want to avoid the ER but still escalate treatment, you could try to look for somewhere that does outpatient IVs. Some urgent cares do them, but many don't, so call first. Where I live the ER is the only option, but I have heard that in other places they have standalone infusion centers that can do this as well. If you have a GP or neurologist that is part of a larger hospital network or medical system, you could ask if they have something like this. If you can't find any good options for that, another possibility is to ask your doctor about getting a steroid taper. If you can get in contact with the doctor that normally manages your migraine prescriptions (either a GP/PCP or neuro can do it), they can often write a script for this without even having to see you in person.

"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. The four month taper is almost certainly the issue given how long you've been on the drug. Delayed onset withdrawal symptoms are not as uncommon as many think. Additional drugs can worsen your condition because it's very likely your nervous system is extra sensitive, so to speak, after stopping the SSRI. Reinstatement may help but there's no way to know ahead of time since it's been so long since your last dose. At this point the best practice is probably to reinstate a very low dose of the original medication (far below what would be considered therapeutic). I'm talking in the ballpark of like a single mg. Reinstating a tiny dose should make it fairly obvious if you feel just slightly better or slightly worse. If you feel slightly better or you feel the same, you can very slowly increase the dose until you see a change either positive or negative. You don't want to reinstate your previous dose all at once because your nervous system might be extra sensitive at this point. Reinstating a tiny dose protects you from making your condition much worse which might happen if you reinstate your original dose, while giving you a small signal about whether increasing the dose might help. Definitely look at survivingantidepressants.org. The experts on the forums there can help you better than anyone on Reddit can. Even most doctors tend not to be very well educated on deprescribing psychiatric drugs. The people on that website see cases like yours all the time. I would also double check your other medications for interactions before reinstating the SSRI, specifically migraine medications tend to interact with the serotonin system. Even if reinstatement doesn't help, it does seem to be the case that the vast, vast majority of people with protracted withdrawal type injuries do get better over time so there is hope!

"I‚Äôm 22 years old with anxiety and I have been smoking weed on a daily basis since 18. I still live with my parents so I‚Äôve only been smoking carts but I have never had any issues or bad highs. A few nights ago I was hitting my cart to try and relieve my migraine. I took 2-3 hits because that‚Äôs all it usually takes for me to get high and I noticed my migraine got worse and was now pulsing, I thought if I ate my munchies I‚Äôd feel better but moments later I started feeling nauseous and once I stopped eating I felt cold tingles on my head and had cold sweats and couldn‚Äôt stop shivering. I was so scared and convinced myself I‚Äôm just havung a panic attack and noticed that my heart rate would return to a notmal rate when I do breathing exercises, but once I stopped the feeling would slowly return again until I took benadryl and the feeling stopped altogether an hour later and I fell asleep. I stopped smoking and gave myself a break for 2 days, and today I bout a new cart from my local dispensary. I had just finished doing my homework, took about 3 puffs while chilling in my bef and suddenly I feel my head feeling cold. Already in my head I‚Äôm thinking oh no what if it happens again?

My friend took over driving and stopped at 711 to grab excedrine while trying to convince me it was a migraine. I was sitting on my passenger floorboard vomiting nonstop as he drove me home. The light was killing me, and I snapped at every word he spoke that was too loud. I spent the next 2 days in my dark, quiet room. Im 35 now.

"(not a doctor, just passing along info from a doctor that helped me) As I understand, migraines (the type I get at least) are more of a symptom than a cause. They can be caused by inflammation (of the inner head, I believe, but not sure). One cause of that can be anaphylaxis, which is where an antihistamine would help. I take benadryl at the onset and I believe it helps stop the cause of the migraine. Anyone who gets migraines should be taking a triptan if they can. Ask a doctor. Generally they are small pills with minimal side effects. If they are bad enough to require botox, you should also probably be taking a cgrp inhibitor once a month as a preventative. And, possibly, a painkiller at onset. Less pain = less inflammation = less chance at rebound migraine.

"#migraine #migrainerelief What is a migraine? It is much more than just a #headache ; it is a neurological condition with attacks that can last for days. While headache pain is the most recognized symptom, migraine attacks involve a wide range of other symptoms. These can include neurological symptoms known as aura, which may present as visual disturbances (like flashing or zigzagging lights, often described as a kaleidoscope appearance), numbness, weakness, double vision, vertigo, difficulty speaking, and more. These symptoms generally occur before the headache begins. There are also premonitory symptoms that may appear before the headache, such as fatigue, yawning, increased thirst or hunger. After the attack, symptoms like tiredness and difficulty concentrating can persist. Migraine attacks are often more complex than many realize. If you think you suffer from migraine attacks, be sure to discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider and follow this channel for more tips and treatments. #pain #headaches #medicine #neurology #migraines ",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The only preventative treatment that I've responded to has been Vyepti 300mg IV infusion. Each round is 3 months apart. The effects are supposed to be accumulative. I've only done 3 rounds so far, but there was a noticeable difference after this 3rd round. It has me down to 25 days a month. My general cognitive clarity is the biggest difference. I am also technically taking Botox as preventative, but it's mainly just listed that way for the insurance. It actually doesn't work for me as a preventative, but it does help as an acute treatment for some of the muscular problems surrounding my eye. I take riboflavin 400mg daily, & magnesium glycinate 400mg daily as recommended by my neuro. I personally didn't have low levels when i started them. They haven't made me feel different, but they aren't hurting anything, so I stick with them jic. Trudhesa 0.725mg/spray & Ubrelvy have been the only acute medications that I've had a response to taking. Both medications say to take the 1st dose then another 2 hours later if needed. With both meds, I always have to take a 2nd dose. I'm hoping that as the migraines generally improve, I'll be able to get down to 1 dose. Trudhesa will make the migraine completely stop 80% of the time. Then I'll have 24-36 hrs free before the next one starts. Ubrelvy makes it stop 60% of the time.

"LIJDT JIJ AAN MIGRAINE? ü§Ø Migraine komt vaker voor bij vrouwen: 1 op de 5 vrouwen heeft er last van, tegen 1 op de 15 mannen. Vrouwen hebben langer last van migraine. Dit komt onder andere door hormonale veranderingen, met name op het gebied van oestrogeen en progesteron, die de hersengebieden be√Ønvloeden die met migraine in verband worden gebracht. üìä Oorzaken van hormonale veranderingen: *Peri & menopauze *menstruatie *het nemen van orale anticonceptiemiddelen *zwangerschap *borstvoeding ‚ö†Ô∏è Migraine is een ernstige hoofdpijn die zich kan presenteren als een kloppende pijn aan √©√©n kant van het hoofd. Het kan ook gepaard gaan met symptomen zoals gevoeligheid voor licht en geluid, braken of misselijkheid. ‚ö†Ô∏è De 2 belangrijkste soorten migraine zijn migraine met aura en migraine zonder aura. Migraine met aura heeft bepaalde waarschuwingssignalen zoals knipperende lichten voordat de hoofdpijn begint, migraine zonder aura heeft dat niet. ‚ö†Ô∏è Oorzaken van migraine kunnen hormonale verschuivingen zijn, bepaalde voedingsmiddelen of dranken, stress, vermoeidheid of een reactie op een zintuiglijke prikkel. Genetische redenen en onevenwichtigheden in de chemische stoffen in de hersenen kunnen ook factoren zijn. üìù Uit een recent onderzoek van Glamour bleek dat tweederde van de vrouwen geen seks had vanwege migraine, driekwart zei dat het een negatieve invloed had op hun sociale leven en werk en 70% zei dat het een uitdaging was om met het gezin om te gaan tijdens een migraineaanval.

"The biggest strain migraines have put on my husband and I's relationship is just him hating how reactive I've been about managing it instead of being proactive. And he's not wrong, me waiting until I was 25+ to see a doctor about migraines has probably done more harm than good, but the migraines themselves have never been an issue for him. I think it's super important to communicate needs and set expectations for yourself and your SO. For example, if I tell my husband ""I'm getting a migraine, I need to take some medicine and lay down"" we both know it means I need to be left alone for a few hours until I'm ready to function again. I'm not asking him to do anything for me, I'm just asking him to wait for me because that's really all I need from him.

"Experiencing pain in the left side of your head and shoulder can be concerning and uncomfortable. This type of pain can arise from various causes, ranging from muscle tension to more serious medical conditions. In this blog, we‚Äôll delve into the possible causes, symptoms, and remedies for left head and shoulder pain. # Common Causes of Left Head and Shoulder Pain 1. **Tension Headaches:** * Tension headaches are among the most common causes of head pain. They are often triggered by stress, poor posture, or muscle strain. The pain typically feels like a tight band around the head and can radiate to the shoulders. 2. **Cervical Radiculopathy:** * This condition occurs when a nerve in the neck becomes compressed or irritated. It can lead to pain that radiates from the neck to the shoulder and down the arm, often accompanied by numbness or tingling. 3. **Shoulder Injuries:** * Injuries to the shoulder, such as rotator cuff tears or bursitis, can cause pain that may also be felt in the head. Overuse or trauma can lead to inflammation and discomfort. 4. **Migraine:** * Migraines often cause unilateral head pain, typically on one side. Symptoms can include nausea, sensitivity to light, and visual disturbances. While migraines usually don‚Äôt directly cause shoulder pain, tension from headache discomfort can lead to shoulder tightness. 5. **Heart Conditions:** * Although less common, pain in the left shoulder and head can sometimes be a sign of heart-related issues, especially if accompanied by other symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or radiating pain in the arm. 6. **Anxiety and Stress:** * Emotional stress and anxiety can lead to muscle tension, which may result in pain in the head and shoulders. It is essential to address the underlying anxiety to alleviate the physical symptoms. # Symptoms to Watch For When experiencing left head and shoulder pain, it‚Äôs important to be aware of accompanying symptoms, which may include: * Numbness or tingling in the arm or hand * Dizziness or lightheadedness * Weakness in the shoulder or arm * Swelling or bruising around the shoulder * Changes in vision or speech If you experience severe pain or any alarming symptoms, seek medical attention promptly. # Home Remedies and Treatment Options Here are some effective ways to manage left head and shoulder pain: 1. **Rest and Relaxation:** * Taking a break and resting can help alleviate tension. Consider practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation. 2. **Heat or Cold Therapy:** * Applying a warm compress or heating pad to the shoulder can help relax tight muscles. Alternatively, cold packs can reduce inflammation and numb the pain. 3. **Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers:** * Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. 4. **Gentle Stretching and Exercises:** * Incorporating gentle neck and shoulder stretches can improve flexibility and relieve tension. However, avoid any movements that exacerbate the pain. 5. **Physical Therapy:** * If pain persists, consulting a physical therapist can provide targeted exercises and techniques to strengthen the shoulder and neck muscles. 6. **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** * If the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms, it‚Äôs essential to seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. # Conclusion Left head and shoulder pain can stem from a variety of causes, some of which are relatively benign, while others may require medical attention. By understanding the potential causes and taking proactive measures, you can effectively manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. If you have any concerns about your pain, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

However, avoid any movements that exacerbate the pain. 5. **Physical Therapy:** * If pain persists, consulting a physical therapist can provide targeted exercises and techniques to strengthen the shoulder and neck muscles. 6. **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** * If the pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms, it‚Äôs essential to seek medical advice for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. # Conclusion Left head and shoulder pain can stem from a variety of causes, some of which are relatively benign, while others may require medical attention. By understanding the potential causes and taking proactive measures, you can effectively manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. If you have any concerns about your pain, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

"do not feel bad about it at all! do what's best for you. the reason I asked about sinus headache is that that often is a question neurologists and headache specialists will ask because 90% of self-reported sinus headaches are migraine. And because many people don't realize that their sinus headache is migraine, it can progress & develop into another migraine type at a different point in life. (it happened to me, it happens to many) I hope rizatriptan gives you relief. if it doesn't, don't be upset. triptans typically are not very effective later on during a migraine attack and you may need to request a steroid taper. Another effective medication for vestibular migraine that you can discuss with your doctor (but they may not feel comfortable prescribing, which is why I sent the Dr Teixido video) is a benzo - that's the most effective acute medication for dizziness (esp when in a dire situation) but it cannot be taken frequently.

"Yes, I have. Mine started when I was 15. That was a long time ago so there wasn't a lot of support or information and I didn't track them. I've had them my whole life and I got them around 4-10 times a month. I also don't track my triggers (I have reasons for that). I started tracking when I got them (but that's all; no triggers or any other information) in 2019 and then in 2021 I went 4.5 months without one and then a month with 4 migraines and then went 3 months without one and then one migraine the next month and then a month and a half gap and then months of normal again and then 6 months without one and then it was regular amount of migraines and then one month gap and variations of that and I'm back on my second month without an attack. I have never in my life before gone a month without a migraine before 2021. I changed nothing. No new medications; no lifestyle changes; no change in diet. The only change was I got older (obviously). The only medication I take for migraines is Maxalt and 1/2 a Tylenol #3 when I get them. Migraines are a complex neurological disease. There is so much that is unknown about it and people like the known. I am not convinced that it is things that we do or don't do that brings on an attack. Triggers are SO hard to pinpoint and it could be a multitude of things we did or didn't do or experienced that week, day, hour or minute. I feel that this is hold over from before when there wasn't anything to treat them and doctors were convinced that it was what we did that made them happen.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"Do you suffer from #headaches #migraine #pain Migraine affects over 50 million people in the U.S! Yet, many individuals do not seek or receive proper care. The reasons for this vary, from lack of awareness about available treatments to the misperception that migraine attacks are simply just headaches that one must endure. This underlines the importance of increasing awareness and education about migraine, encouraging those affected to seek the help they need. Fortunately, there are several effective ways to manage these disabling headaches. Lifestyle changes such as sleep habits, diet, and exercise can play a crucial role in reducing the frequency and severity of migraine attacks. There are various medications available, ranging from over-the-counter pain relievers, to prescription drugs and even injections. You don‚Äôt have to endure migraine attacks alone. By seeking appropriate care and making informed lifestyle choices, you can significantly reduce the impact of migraines on your daily life.

"Seconding fioricet. It's the only med I have tried over the years that has helped. like the above, I take it with 1 benadryl and sometimes a cup of coffee at the first sign of my aura. It basically stops me from barreling into a full-blown migraine. I still will have a mid-grade headache, light/smell sensitivity, and brain fog, but I am still functional and don't need to be in bed. If I have to, I can continue to function almost normally, but I am more tired and foggy than usual. I only get true migraines every couple months now, and this has worked remarkably well for me for almost 10 years. My neuro likely wouldn't keep prescribing it if I had more frequent migraines since it has a risk of addiction, but I rarely take more than 2 in a month so she keeps prescribing (for now). Every other med, aside from botox (which has greatly helped my daily headaches but hasn't seemed to change my aura migraines), either didn't work, gave me terrible side effects, or both.

"April 5, 2008. It's 3pm. I just woke up after attending an all night charity fundraiser at college. I got back to the dorm around 8am. I'd had headaches before, but this was the first migraine. Woke up and held was pounding, the light streaming in through the window was aggravating and my dormmates making noise up and down the halls made me want to die. I went to the bathroom and nearly puked from the lights and smells. Went back to bed and passed out after taking some advil. My mom called later on to ask how the fundraiser did, and I told her I had a migraine and couldn't talk. She asked how I knew it was a migraine. My exact words: because the sound of your voice makes me want to kill myself. She quickly hung up. I started having them frequently. Like... very very frequently. 4-5x a week. I ended up dropping out due to my inability to go to class because excedrin had stopped working less than a year in. Don't wait like I did. See a doctor immediately. I would probably be in a much different place in life if I'd started seeing a doctor in 2008, instead of 2012.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I'll admit, managing abdominal migraines is hella challenging, but I'll provide whatever input that I can and have personally found helpful, and you can take it or leave it üòä Medications like triptans can be effective like you mentioned, but they aren‚Äôt ideally meant for regular use. You might want to discuss preventive medications with your doctor, such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or antiepileptic drugs, which can help reduce the frequency of attacks. Dietary changes are important, too. You‚Äôve already taken a great step by removing sugar from your diet. Other adjustments to consider include staying well-hydrated, avoiding common trigger foods like caffeine, chocolate, processed foods, and foods high in histamine like aged cheeses and cured meats, and eating small, regular meals to stabilize blood sugar levels. Lifestyle modifications can make a big difference here as well. Stress management techniques like meditation, yoga, and deep-breathing exercises can help manage stress, which is a common trigger for migraines. My migraines are also my excuse for prioritizing looonnnggg sleep sessions üò¥ üòÖ because maintaining a regular sleep schedule and ensuring adequate sleep is imperative in reducing the likelihood of attacks. Regular, moderate exercise can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraines, too. Although it‚Äôs important to be cautious of overexertion. Some people find relief with supplements like riboflavin (vitamin B2), magnesium, and coenzyme Q10. I personally don't, but to each their own, everyone has to find what works well for them. Keeping a migraine diary can also be useful. Tracking your symptoms, diet, sleep patterns, and other potential triggers can help identify patterns and triggers specific to you, which can be valuable in managing the condition. Hopefully, this was some helpful baseline information that you can use as a jumping-off point if you ever find out that you're one of the few other unlucky suckers like me who are blessed with this misunderstood nightmare.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

If you take OTC medicines more than 14 days out of the month for say, a back injury, you could develop MOH which is a secondary migraine disorder. They really should tell everyone upon diagnosis.

"Some good and bad advice in here. It‚Äôd be nice to see someone from neurology comment on the relevant best modern evidence. No one should be getting SC sumatriptan as a single-agent abortive agent in the ED. As someone who has had migraines, triptans are really only maximally effective during the prodromal and early phase of headache. Once you‚Äôre in an emergency department, antidopamenergics have the best evidence. Compazine/Reglan/Droperidol + Benadryl + 1 L of Cola (NS) FTW. 90% first-strike success rate. Make them call someone to pick them up. Typically 2 hr disposition if you know how to do it correctly. Nurses don‚Äôt want to do an IV? It‚Äôs a migraine. If you‚Äôve never had one (most people who say they have migraines really just have bad headaches), it‚Äôs absolutely cruel and unusual to punt these people to the street without appropriate abortive therapy. I agree with others than 4 mg of slow IVP Decadron should be the last thing the nurses pushes before DCing IV. Finally, the dopamine antagonist fix a ton of other, ahem, secondary patient problems in the ED. I find that a lot of unexplained young female abdominal pain is actually abdominal migraine with near complete and fantastical resolution of all pain following a little squirt of Compazine/Droperidol.

"It‚Äôs safe to say I have no idea what is going on. The last few days I‚Äôve gotten really bad headaches/migraines but I‚Äôve gone about my days because I had them pre pregnancy. Today I had a migraine and my baby wasn‚Äôt moving as much as usual. I saw my doctor, she checked his heart rate and then monitored his movements and gave him the all clear. I told her about my migraines and she said if they come back tomorrow, to go to the hospital. I‚Äôm 38 weeks, my blood pressure has been normal, she‚Äôs not worried about preeclampsia, I don‚Äôt have gestational diabetes, or low blood sugar. Would the hospital induce me for migraines? Has anyone else had this?
So I‚Äôm personally not sure where bad headaches end and migraines begin. I will say though, at 37 weeks pregnant, I‚Äôve been getting bad headaches pretty consistently for the past 5ish days. They come on at around 10/11am and fade at around 8/9pm. I‚Äôve been drinking a lot as well, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dehydration. I‚Äôve also been blessed to have a normal and healthy pregnancy, so no other issues that could have caused this to my knowledge. The only thing I can think of is I‚Äôve weaned myself off coffee and haven‚Äôt had any for the past few months (to help with the acid reflux) and I started having coffee again this past week. I‚Äôve never had coffee cause headaches before though, so I can‚Äôt understand how that would be connected.

"Reasons to consider for Botox 1.Wrinkle Reduction - Botox effectively reduces the appearance of dynamic wrinkles, such as crow's feet, frown lines, and forehead lines, by temporarily relaxing the facial muscles that cause them. 2.Non-Surgical Solution - Botox is a non-surgical procedure, offering a quick and relatively painless solution with minimal downtime compared to more invasive cosmetic procedures like facelifts. 3.Medical Benefits **Migraine Relief:** Botox has been approved for the treatment of chronic migraines, providing relief for many patients by reducing the frequency and severity of headache attacks. **Hyperhidrosis Treatment:** It effectively treats hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), particularly in the underarms, hands, and feet, by blocking the nerves that stimulate sweat glands. **Muscle Spasm Control:** Botox can be used to treat muscle spasms and disorders such as cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and other conditions characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. 4.Quick and Convenient- The procedure typically takes about 10-15 minutes, making it convenient for those with busy schedules. **Immediate Results:** While the full effects may take a few days to appear, some improvement can be seen within 24-48 hours, offering relatively quick results. 5.Boosts Confidence- By smoothing out wrinkles and lines, Botox can enhance a person's overall appearance, leading to increased self-confidence and improved self-esteem. 6.Customizable Treatments - It can be tailored to individual needs and desired outcomes, allowing for a natural look that maintains facial expressiveness. 7.Safe and Effective - Botox is one of the most extensively studied and tested cosmetic treatments, with a strong safety profile and a long history of successful use in both cosmetic and medical applications. P.S - It should only be taken from trained and qualified Dermatologist ‚úÖ #dermatologist #skinspecialist #botox #botulinumtoxin #wrinkle #finelinesandwrinkle #fineline #aging #flawlessskin #skincarecommunity #skincare [Dermatologist, Botox, Wrinkles, Ageing, fine lines]",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Both have been effective at staving away migraine attacks for months, for me at least. I dunno what strain of mushrooms they were, but they were a kind of cubensis. I did a slow ramp up. 1st go was .4g. Two weeks later, .8g. Two weeks later, 1.2g. Continuing until I hit 2g, and took a break. No migraine attack for several months, after which the symptoms started slowly crawling back. LSD has backing too. It's derived from ergotamine, which was used since classical Greece to treat migraine. I also use cannabis everyday for prevention and rescue. I understand you've tried and it wasnt for you, which can happen. I'll only add that it started working best for me once I started using it more frequently and regularly. Before regular use, the THC overload would trigger an attack sometimes. Now I try to keep THC balanced with other cannabinoids, and it works better than either irregular use or too much THC.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"hi! I work for a virtual neurology clinic that specializes in migraine. happy to answer questions. Cove is great if you need simple migraine acute medications (for attacks) or basic migraine preventive medications (daily meds to manage the disease). All care is provided by text messaging. The clinic where I work is more geared toward patients at the more severe end of the spectrum who need specialized care (but we also treat episodic migraine). In addition to headache specialist appointments by zoom, you get care coaching, a care curriculum, care plans, and a care team to help you along the way. Both are great options depending on your need. If you just need a prescription refill and you know what you need, Cove is excellent.

"Blue to the sky‚Ä¶ July 30, 2024 ~ k I was on the phone with my friend last night who lives 40ish minutes away from me. She recently started a new migraine medication that is an injection and, last night, started a higher dose. As I was talking to her, she started coughing and wheezing and I was getting really concerned so I grabbed my purse and left my house and started heading towards her house, (probably faster than the speed limit). Anyway, when I got to her, her blood pressure was 90/50 and she looked terrible. I have epi pens at home and have a general idea on how to use them, and thankfully, she has them too. I know the rule of, ‚Äúblue to the sky, orange to the thigh.‚Äù Meaning the blue part goes up and the orange part is the stabby part. I stabbed her with her epi pen and drove her the five minutes to the emergency room, (it would have honestly taken longer to get an ambulance and get to the er than it would have to just get her into my car). So yeah. Fun times. She‚Äôs still feeling a little gross this morning, but her PCP gave her some more steroids and I thought she will be okay. Whew! Photo by me.

"I have a‚Ä¶thing? device? Called an AuraEase. I bought it because I had $$ left over in my FSA account last year. Did not except much from it at all, but it‚Äôs turned out to be surprisingly helpful. It doesn‚Äôt *cure* anything, but it helps more than other non-drugs I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs a mask that straps tightly over my forehead and eyes, almost up to my hairline. It is rechargeable. When you turn it on, it heats up and applies pressure. For a 15-minute cycle, I believe. It kinda reminds me of those old massage chairs? That‚Äôs how the face massage feels. The pressure kinda rolls from different directions. You can change the heat settings and the pressure settings‚Äîboth all the way from ‚Äústrong‚Äù to ‚Äúoff.‚Äù You can also pair it to Bluetooth and it will play music / podcasts / whatever. I believe it also has built-in music, if you want that. This is so not my kind of thing, but until the summer got so ungodly hot I was using it all the time. You cannot OD on it, it can‚Äôt give you a rebound headache, and it‚Äôs so relaxing that I‚Äôve fallen asleep with it on my face many times.

"I don't remember anything memorable about those tests. I don't think it helps that I often get a milder version of the lightheadedness for hours at a time/sometimes it's just an entire day, so often I have symptoms already going into the test and it's harder to tell if it's causing anything. But I know it didn't cause me to faint or feel extremely sick. Another problem is that I often have the ""whitecoat"" syndrome (or whatever it's actually called) where my blood pressure will rise when I'm at doctors because I stress about their offices (and especially blood tests, after the fainting and bad experiences with people getting angry at me for being nervous.) More than a few times I've had really low blood pressure at home (checked with a wrist cuff, back when I had one) but at the doctor my bp is ""great"" because it's raised enough it's in the lower end of healthy range. The lowest it ever got at home was 85/something and I was feeling very tired, lightheaded, and cold at the time, but we didn't go to the doctor since money was bad. That first link, I don't remember any sort of cognitive test in between - I just remember them asking me to lay down and taking my bp, then having me sit up and stay still then taking it again, and I'm pretty sure they had me stand then took it one more time. They asked me if I felt like I was going to faint and how I was feeling at each point but that was it. I know I've had three doctors do it the same way and it definitely felt like a quick/easy test. My primary doctor referred me to a neurologist, but I had a really rough experience with him - despite the nurse taking my symptoms down and going over things with me for almost the whole appointment time, he came in asking me about ""former conditions"" I'd never said, cut me off when I was explaining my symptoms, said it was likely migraine-related but we'd do an EEG to check for seizures and get me on migraine medication. The EEG was clean and I ended up not taking the medication because it was apparently one that could cause serotonin syndrome taken with an unrelated medicine I was already on - didn't learn that until I went to the pharmacy to get it and after that I didn't really feel comfortable seeing him anymore. My primary said she was sorry it went badly and said if I could find another neurologist I liked in my insurance, she'd get me a referral, I just.. have had no clue what sort of specialist to see and many are booked for so far out that I'd be seeing them when I no longer had that insurance since my plan is going to end next year. I don't have a Facebook, but I'll see if I can find autonomic specialists in my area (and plan) or if she has one she'd want to refer me to.

"Oh my gosh!! Honestly that is so typical of neurologists üôÑ if you can definetly switch. Getting a second, third, fourth opinion seems essential for TN or most invisible illnesses unfortunately :( Idk how much time you‚Äôve spent on the forum, BUT i have posted a lengthy ‚Äúhow i got out of pain‚Äù I‚Äôll copy/paste the text below! (Couldn‚Äôt figure out how to copy/paste the link on my phone lol) ________________________________________ What helped me to be pain-free (TN2) I have been on this forum for a couple of years and just commenting. But I thought it might be helpful to share how I became pain-free - the meds, pain management procedures I found most helpful, the surgeries I did, the kind of doctors I saw, and the neurosurgeon I saw. Unfortunately, it seems you have to go through/fail other body systems - ENT, Dental, etc - for insurance and doctors to establish that you have TN. Then you have to fail noninvasive treatments for TN - medications (seizure meds), nerve blocks, etc - for insurance and doctors to refer you to neurosurgery. Once you do several procedures can help eliminate/greatly reduce the pain. But you have to find a neurosurgeon who is not a square. This is all doable when you know the system and have support. **Quick Summary:** 28F, TN2 from 2014 - 2020, Nerve pain-free since 2020 **Initial Pain** The pain started at 19. It felt like thumbs were digging into my temples. Constant. As soon as I woke up till I fell asleep. **Navigating a Diagnosis** ***ENT)*** I first went to ENT since I felt a pressure pain sensation. I had 3 ENT surgeries - deviated septum, turbinate reduction, and sinus surgery. Although all of these might of been necessary surgeries none of these helped reduce the constant pain I had. ENT was ruled out. ***NEURO)*** Went to neurology and was prescribed an anti-seizure medication. The following meds were ruled out because could not tolerate the side effects of the following meds or they did not touch my pain - Keppra, Tegretol, Trileptal, Gapentin, Lyrica. I found the most relief with Topomax. I would not say my pain disappeared with this medication, rather it dulled the intensity. This was helpful. Although my pain was regarded as a migraine or NDPH - A new daily persistent headache - I still needed topomax to somewhat function. Neuro is a must. ***DENTAL)*** after one neurosurgery team told me I didn‚Äôt have TN they diagnosed me with TMJ... bless their hearts. ***PAIN MANAGEMENT)*** lidocaine occipital injections = never worked on me occipital nerve block = worked for a while then stopped Botox for migraines = worked and they can do the occipital region, the neck, TMJ sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block = worked super well -(but they can do it x-ray guided or non x-ray guided w/cotton swabs... don‚Äôt do the cotton swabs doesn‚Äôt work as accurately) Marinol, a synthetic cannabinoids used to treat neuropathic chronic pain = worked very well. Gave me relief. And I could take 5mg or 10mg for bad pain. I felt safer knowing it was doctor-prescribed. And I think it establishes that you do have neuropathic pain. And my insurance did cover it. Lidocaine patches = worked well when my pain changed. I would put them on my face. Doctor prescribed. *Kind of doctor you should find for this = board-certified physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R) physician with board-certified sub-specialization in pain medicine* **Pain Change** Around 2018 my pain evolved. I began having facial sensations - wind, makeup, smiling hurting my face. And I could no longer manage my pain anymore. The meds and pain management procedures stopped working (quality and quantity) and I was becoming non-functional. This is when we started looking toward surgery **SURGERY** I saw Dr. Michael Lim, Chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at Stanford Medicine known around the world for his expertise in the care of people with trigeminal neuralgia. [https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/238246](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/238246) He did two Microvascular Decompressions and a Rhizotomy on the left side a year later. My images did not show signs of compression. But Dr. Lim said he would still do the surgery because he found that even combing the trigeminal nerve helped patients with their pain. But once he was in my brain he saw the compressed nerve. So if your images are negative that isn‚Äôt the be-all end-all. **Conclusion** I feel like it seems I am put together by this post. But I was a mess during this time. I was depressed and so angry. And that part of TN or chronic illness isn‚Äôt talked about enough. Heck, it isn‚Äôt researched enough to even be talked about. But It is really hard. And it is hard to trust doctors who have no idea what this pain feels like. What this pain takes away. I hope this information helps. Because there is light at the end of this horrific tunnel. I promise.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"It depends on the place you‚Äôre going to, but it‚Äôs usually just a combination of things like NSAIDs (Toradol, Tylenol, etc.), Bendadryl, caffeine, anti-nausea meds, and magnesium.

"I'm someone who has had headaches my whole life and they got worse with every year until about 12 years ago where I had a series of one six month log migraine or a 5-month long migraine to the point where I was seeing some of the top specialists in the US for it including being hospitalized and getting a PIC line with medications to try to break it. During this process I ended up going to the emergency room in the desperate plea to have some relief has nothing was working I was given an IV cocktail of reglan and toradol. What happened was a huge anxiety attack I could not feel any kind of relief I felt panic and fear like the walls were closing around me and I told them if they didn't take the IV out I would take it out myself and I basically ran out of the ER. It took me months to figure out what happened and why. And it was later my neuro gave me a pill called compazine and it started to produce similar effects within me, extreme agitation and since I could not settle myself and an extreme anxiety. Also the only other thing that seemed to help my migraines was Benadryl but Benadryl along with most cold medications will give me severe restless leg. And the only other time I remembered having RLS was in puberty and then it went away after some time. As I was researching what was going on with me in these medications I came to learn that some anti-emetics and some antipsychotics which are sometimes used to try to break a migraine are dopamine scrubbers and I started to ask myself why am I like the one percent or 2% of people to have this effect? Does it mean that maybe I have less free-range dopamine than other people in my system? I had long suspected that I had ADHD but I always felt I was masking well enough to often cover for it but as I started to move into perimenopause the effects got so bad that it almost made me lose complete control of my business The mistakes I was making and my lack of attention to details even when I was really trying and had plan a plan b and plan c feel safe knowing that these are problems of mine we're not working. At the age of 43 I finally got the diagnosis and got on Adderall and it was unlike anything I had ever experienced in my life. All of the reading social anxiety that I had where I felt I just was never good enough and that others might be harmful to me and this persistent social anxiety that has been the bane of my existence went away that noise went completely away for the first time in my life. I was so surprised by that effect I had no idea that the medication would even touch that I was seeking out the medication just to stop losing everything and forgetting everything. The other thing it did is it turned the volume down to my emotions I remember my ex-husband saying things like you can think about something and then have a feeling about that thing and that sounded impossible to me because inside of me was like that Muppet character animal he played the drums, that my emotions were so fast and so loud I was overtaken by them there was no space between thoughts and feelings feelings were a storm I had to endure. And I felt as much a victim of those as I'm sure everyone around me did but with the medication the range of those feelings the rage, the despair, the ideations it all quieted I had no idea the medication would help me with this. With the medication I began to be consistent in my habits for the first time in my life and be able to remember things and catch my mistakes as I'm making them. Losing my things was not a constant and persistent problem but a once in a while problem. As a result my business began to do very well and I published my book which one a major award. I'm by no means ""cured"" perfect but I think about who I was for most of my life and how I was blamed for how I was or shunned for how I was or scapegoated or just avoided and I think many of us have that persistent innate brokenness within us that I had no I just couldn't help it and I didn't have the words to even understand what was wrong for most of my life. I will never be good at math I love the concept the details always upend me. I will always forget things I will always forget to shut the kitchen cabinets I will get my names wrong I will forget important dates. But now that I have a more adequate supply of dopamine it makes me realize with great clarity how much easier it is to have that appropriate amount and how my whole life I was judged as if I was the same as everyone else. And the good news is I got medication that has practically eliminated my migraines due to world class biologics. I am on Adderall which has been an absolute miracle in game changer for me, and I'm on hormones to help with my perimenopausal swings and with these three things taken care of for the first time in my life ever I have felt okay I have felt stable I have felt comfortable within myself and all of that all of that came from asking myself why some of these migraine medications were throwing me into panic attacks. And I wonder if anyone else here has a similar story.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"It's a miracl drug ,for me. I've had chronic migraines since I was a kid. Over the years I was pretty much incapacitated with daily,one sided head pain and all kinds of tag along symptoms. Throughout the years other issues were added. Shingles in my ear (same side)and bells palsey. A TBI .The pain was non-stop day in,day out. Down the road I was diagnosed with one of the top 3 worst pain conditions known to man (it's not just my opinion. It's documented ) Trigeminal Neuralgia. Tried several meds with no luck. TN fell by the wayside. I spent most of my adult life searching for something to help my migraines.After taking every migraine med available I recently saw a new to the practice aprn. She ordered pregabalin(Lyrica). I told her I was on Neurontin for many years when young . I had to stop it because it ruined my liver. It also didn't help. I started at 75mg 2 times per day. Titrated to 100mg 2 times per day. I couldn't believe it. My face,ear and head pain eased up. Soon I started having breakthrough pain. I asked to do 3 per day instead of increasing the mgs. Now I take 3 per day . I can't believe I suffered that horrible pain 24/7 365,since 1989. The rest of my chronic conditions and pain still keep me down but I can't put into words how thankful I am to be able to mostly control that particular pain. Pregabalin is the one and only best medicine for T N. Now I've also gained control over my migraines,with the right meds. What a difference when a diagnosis is aknowledged and treated with the right medication. I am so grateful....

"I have been looking for solutions, remedies, anything since I posted the original question 5 years ago.

The best we've been able to do is a combo of aspirin for the headache, ginger pills for the dizziness and sleep it off. My husband absolutely refuses to try anything other than aspirin, so it is possible that something like Excedrin Migraine might work better.

"Over two years ago I (35f) went to the doctors as I had not had a period in months and I had put over 2 stone in weight on in as many months (even pregnant I have never weighed this much). He sent me for blood tests and said my thyroid was 136 to take 50mcg levothyroxine and my periods would come back I would lose weight but that I would be on it for life. He also referred me to an Endocrinologist. A month or so later it had come down considerably to around 40s and then a few weeks again to about 12, after this he told me to stop taking it and that was that. I had not had a period I had not lost weight. He then sent me for PCOS tests but I confirmed I aready was diagnosed with this 20 years ago he sent me anyway scan and blood test confirmed I have PCOS. I also started getting what I can only describe as a cluster headache or migraine (it is behind one eye and down to my top teeth) another doctor prescribed sumatriptan which worked. Otherwise I would be in so much pain I would take painkillers and cry mself to sleep for 24 hours. Anyway I still have the same problem with my periods, looking at the pattern it seems to be that I don't have a period for roughly 6 months then I have maybe 1 a month for 2-3 months in a row then they stop again. I have a family history or uterine cancer (nana at 30 years old full hysterectomy), endometriosis and PCOS my aunt has similar symtoms to me and also had a full hysterectomy at 37. However my mum has no issues and is over 50 not even perimenopausal. I take no medication currently my last blood test showed thyroid at 3 and I have a headache that I have been in bed with for 2 days I have been keeping up with the gym (mostly running and swimming) and watching what I eat and have lost no weight that I gained from 2 years ago. I went to the Endocrinologist after an 18 month wait, they said they didn't know why I was there as my thyroid was in normal range and told my doctor to refer me to a gyno which after waiting for 5 months into a 12month list the receptionist told me he hadn't gotten round to so I have a doctors appointment next week and he will refer me from there. I know this is a lot and I don't expect anyone to read it however I don't know where else to turn to and I feel like I am lost as to what to even suggest to my doctors, if I suggest nothing he is happy to just send me home and I can't live like this surely going months without a period and then the weight not changing when I eat well and work out is a cause for concern plus the headaches",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had a migraine every day for several months and once a month I would get a menstrual migraine that was a 10. Several years ago I ended up with idiopathic neuropathy after living in a house with black mold. The nerve damage was confirmed by biopsy. The pain was not just in the extremities but all over. Even the tip of my nose. I can't take the meds they usually use for nerve pain. That was worse than the 10 migraine. Just went through shingles this summer. That was between a 6 and 7.5.

I am one of the 1.1 billion people who has migraines! I normally make octopus content but as someone who has lived her whole life with chronic migraines I‚Äôd like to do some awareness and education on the neurological disease in addition to my marine biology content! Migraines are horribly debilitating and most often they are described as laying in a dark room/bathroom with no sound and throwing up all day. Lasting days to weeks. What is frequently not talked about is those who experience chronic migraines and how different our migraines become after years of an endless migraine! I am currently seeing reduction in my chronic migraines for the first time in my life due to my ADHD diagnosis and medication. Untreated ADHD is a known comorbodity with migraine. Pushing for a diagnosis in my mid-20‚Äôs has started to dramatically change my life.

"I have been a Kratom user for 7-8yrs. 7-20gpd. 10years ago, when I first researched Kratom, I was under the impression that Kratom was in addictive. I eventually decided to try it in place of my opioid prescription for severe hip pain. Oh boy was I wrong. It most definitely is addictive. I'm noticing there is so much more info on the subject now, than it use to be..... Anywho, so I accidentally got myself addicted to Kratom and didn't even notice until 6 days ago, when I was giving no choice but to go without. But 24hrs, I was sweating but freezing, jumping and jittering. My mind was all over the place. Body hurts so bad. By 48 hrs, it was all amplified by 10. I couldn't sleep because I couldn't stop moving. Exhausted, yet wide awake. I finally smoked some THC, I got 2hrs of sleep. By 72hrs, it hit even deeper. The brain fog was so bad too. I'd be in mid sentence and forgot what I was talking about. Not to mention I was babysitting for my best friend while she was on her honeymoon. It was awful. The fourth day, I was super fatigued and lethargic. Felt like I had the flu on steroids. Sneezy, nose and eyes watering, my limbs were jumping all over the place. I had someone offer to bring me some Kratom to stop the withdrawal. I told them ""no. I've made it this far, I'm slaying this demon"". I was so proud of me in that moment. Another night of 2hr sleep. Day 5, I still felt a little fatigued. Not bad. Cravings weren't as bad. Migraine from out of this world. Still, no sleep. Had someone else offer to help me out to stop the withdrawal. Again, I denied the offer. Another night of 2hr sleep. Ugh. Now I'm on day 6. So far I feel ok. Small headache. Body so exhausted. But my spirit is up and happy...... During this time what has helped me is having a focus on taking care of these children. Luckily, one is much older and was super helpful around the house and with his younger sibling. They knew nothing. I told them I caught a bug, and I'd still cook, clean, sat outside with them. I played it cool. I reached out to those I trust the most for support, as soon as I recognized that I was withdrawaling. They were helpful, and right by their phones at all times. Vitamin C packets, massive amounts of water, coffee, Motrin, Excedrin, hot baths, and THC at night time, helped a lot...... No, this isn't the first time I've been through something like this. But it's been a long time. 15yrs long time. I was addicted to opioids in my past. My reasoning for wanting to trade my prescriptions for Kratom. I thought because it was natural, I'd be good....... I say all of this to say, if you are taking yourself off of Kratom and are currently going through withdrawals, just know you aren't alone. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Don't give up.

"It took me years to learn that nobody knows the level of somebody else's pain. For years I tried not to take any pills for my migraines. I worked through them. I was MISERABLE. None of the ""remedies"" really work well for me. My migraines are genetic, have many triggers and get very strong. However, I'm lucky that milder off the shelf pain relief pills work for me. I try to use them reasonably, but I don't feel that I have to endure pain anymore. . All that said, here is what I think about this tylenol Daytime relief acetaminophen (paracetamol for my European friend) and caffeine tablets (received for free). Regular Tylenol doesn't work well for me, but this new version with caffeine is very good. I knew from before that caffeine works for my migraines (it may make them worse for some people), so I was excited to try these pills, and I'm happy to report that my migraine started subsiding about 30 minutes after taking one pill, which is comparable to other pain killers I use.

So I have had a status/intractable migraine for about 4 months now. Non stop 24/7 daily pain. I have been on Sumitriptan and zomig with no results. Also I was given a few steroid shots and they have not relented. I feel like they are definitely getting worse. Unfortunately I live in Japan right now and the health care is pretty bad. My neurologist told me that I have tried all the medications for migraines. And the ER here is a joke. My arm would literally need to be detached or falling off before they give me any sort of pain medicine. I'm coming back to America this Saturday and I won't have health insurance for probably a month. I can't buy insurance now but I will be able to when I get back to the states since I qualify for a QLE. My main concern is getting through that month or even the first day. With my pain level at a constant 8/9 the minute I land I want to go to the Urgent Care. I guess I'm just wondering what all they can do for this? And how much am I expected to pay out of pocket. I'm so desperate for this migraine to break but I cannot afford the ER.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

">The differences are statistically significant, but given that the intake of EPA and DHA would essentially skyrocket if you went from 0 fish to 2 servings per week Fish aren't the exclusive way to obtain those fatty acids in the blood. Additionally, serum levels or blood cell levels are just what's in immediate circulation, it doesn't tell you much about tissue levels in for example the brain or retina. Even so, red blood cell membrane levels are more reflective of habitual intake than serum levels per se. Serum levels aren't the full picture. It's just a snapshot in time with no reference to utilisation. Imagine I have a blunt with top quality Afghani kush, but I don't smoke it, it just sits there and gathers dust and mould. My neighbour also has a spliff, but he's smoking and replacing his spliff every single day. Based on information that we both have a doobie each in our houses, and no other information at all, you'd be pressed to predict that we'll have the same amount of THC in our blood, while in reality the level of weed we have in our houses is not at all indicative of our usage of said weed. So it's not even impossible to have similar level of o3s in the serum while experiencing a relief from migraine by taking o3s. Lastly, epa and dha are not storage forms of o3, the closest to storage form of both is dpa, that that has been shown to increase with o3 supplementation. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4555130/",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Yup, I know I‚Äôve got a migraine coming on because I first get a blind spot in my vision almost like I stared at a bright light too long, then tv static snakes that slowly expand, then slowly move out of my field of vision, then the headache starts.

"hi! I'm sorry that your doctor hasn't been more helpful. Is your doctor a GP or a neurologist? Do you have symptoms beyond dizziness? If you have vestibular migraine, meclizine won't be helpful (benzos are more effective for vestibular migraine). Additionally, a triptan taken this late in the attack won't be helpful either. If your provider thinks that you have vestibular migraine, the emergency room won't be very helpful unless you provide them with a protocol of what you need (ie: doctor's note outlining intravenous medication, etc). Migraine attacks, left untreated, can last 4-72hrs. If they extend beyond that, it's considered status migrainosus which requires stronger interventions like steroids or intravenous medication.

"I'm so glad to hear you have a team and you're not going into this alone or with a single rogue neurologist with no idea. I've really heard some horror stories about treatment and patient care of HM patients. I had to wait 6 months to even see a neurologist after my first HM attack, which was so difficult. I know how it feels to not be able to move, and feel like it's making it worse. If you can't exercise, don't be too hard on yourself. Your body might need the rest more than you think! HM is so hard on your body and mind, the brain fog is intense. In the meantime, make sure you have blue-light filters enabled on your devices.

"i also am a side effect magnet and i had a hellscape of a time trialing other meds, but Emgality has been amazing for me! no side effects and it basically halved my migraine frequency and helped minimize the severity of attacks. it's not a perfect fix but i feel that it's given me my life back more than any other med. so i'm hopeful you have a good experience with it! some advice: the injections hurt more than their tutorial video makes it seem, lol. i'm not normally uncomfy with needles and i've got a ton of tattoos with no problem but the auto-injector is pretty nasty. in my experience the pre-filled syringe is a bit less painful. that said, either of them are still totally doable with some prep. i find taking it out of the fridge for at least a couple hours before helps cause if it's still cold it'll hurt more. ice the injection site well, swab with alcohol and make sure that it's dried before you inject. taking some painkillers before can help. i also take allergy meds (zyrtec) a couple hours before injecting as that's helped with injection site irritation, but i have super sensitive skin so that might just be a me issue. best part is once it's done you don't have to think about it for a month! best of luck with it!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Few issues: 1. Cravings are a symptom of migraine disease, especially during prodrome, suggesting the migraine attack has already started. 2. The role of neurotransmitters and this common prodrome symptom is not something I'm aware of. Do you have any sources to support this? 3. There is no such thing as migraine due to reactive hypoglycemia. If someone has true postprandial hypoglycemia, further investigations are needed to determine why they have it. Gastric bypass? NIPHS? Etc. 4. As for additives and preservatives being a migraine trigger... anything can be a migraine trigger. Anything that throws a patient's homeostasis off can be a trigger. While there are common triggers, there are also very unique triggers people may have. Even food consistency may be a trigger for some. The goal is to use lifestyle modifications, preventives, and abortives properly to make those triggers matter less. Leading a life with the least morbidity possible is the goal. 5. There is more evidence for a keto diet, high omega-3 diet, or a Mediterranean diet than a low glycemic index diet. 6. A healthy diet and lifestyle is definitely important in terms of migraine management and if a low glycemic diet helps you do that then great. For others, other healthy lifestyle measures will likely be part of their plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"No, it's definitely not a you problem. I don't have any research at hand, and I will go down a wormhole for a few hours if I start looking for some, which is my natural inclination, so I apologize. I do know that having ADHD makes people more prone to all types of headaches, partially because we have trouble managing things like regular sleep schedules, eating regularly, remembering to hydrate, that can trigger a headache or a migraine. Also a lot of ADHD medications have headaches as side effects. However, if you read through threads here about symptoms people get with a migraine, losing the ability to focus is and think clearly is a very common one, even for people without ADHD. I can only speak from personal experience, but if I get a bad migraine, even if I'm medicated, my ADHD symptoms change from struggling to control my focus, but being able to make some choices about what actions I take or where I point my attention, to where it just feels like I'm on a ride, with my focus just going from one thing to the next and I can't choose what to do with my time or really even think in a linear way. Then the day is suddenly finished and I have no idea what I did with it, except jump from one stimuli to the next.

"Got it. Unfortunately, a derm won't know the PREEMPT protocol the same way your neurologist will and you won't have the same level of success (been in a similar situation but a neurotologist did mine in a moment of desperation instead of a headache specialist and the results were awful). Just because someone knows how to perform Botox for some procedures doesn't mean they know ALL the procedures and PREEMPT is very specific and requires training. Only if you feel comfortable sharing, who's currently treating you? Is it a general neurologist or a headache specialist? And, again only if you're comfortable, where do you receive in-patient infusions? Our situations are somewhat parallel (daily pain & attacks, unsuccessful medication trials, etc) but it seems that our quality of care and provider communication differ dramatically.

"Hi Y‚Äôal‚Äù. (I‚Äôm going to explain it in and out so can be triggering to some) I‚Äôm 30F. I‚Äôve had migraine for more than half my life - 17 years and counting. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been more than that, since before that I didn‚Äôt feel it serious enough to ask my parents to take me to the doctor. It‚Äôs always been the severe, chronic episodes of strong tingling starting from the finger tips of the one side of my body, goes up from the arm till the shoulder, covering half my chest, then half the neck, up till the head, including the tongue. Immediately after would follow the visual effects - the bright spot of light turning into a big web covering the entire eye. All the drama used to go on for about an hour and a half or so and then it stops. Only, to be followed by a pulsating, throbbing headache. Mostly on the opposite side of where all this other drama was going on. This started when I was 13. Went on till 15 days back. I would love to share with you all that I used to think that my trigger was acidity - and that I only have to regulate the food I eat and that my migraine will stop. And tell you what. It in fact did control to a larger extent. My attacks which happened 3-4 in a week, reduced to one per quarter or once every two months at max. Until a fortnight back. Things have been really tough and I had been under a lot of stress of late. That said - I witnessed a constant sensory aura, no visual one, one without a migraine for over a day and to rule out the possibility of a stroke, I went to a neurologist. Got a plain MRI, some blood tests and an EEG done. My MRI result states - Minimally hyperintense subependymal nodules in the lateral margin of left lateral ventricle without any blooming heterotopic grey matter nature. Rest all results are fine. The doctor has prescribed a preventive migraine medication and one to neutralise the effects of an ongoing attack. The problem is - I‚Äôm on this medication since last 15 days. The medication that I‚Äôm supposed to have whenever I get a migraine, I‚Äôm having it regularly because I‚Äôm having one or the other symptom daily while consuming the preventive medication. The other problem is that these medications have made me really lethargic. I feel sleepy during the day and sleepless during the night. My sinuses feel a constant pressure now which wasn‚Äôt the case before. I have sensory auras every other day and a constant headache every 2-3 days. Also these medications have made my stomach so warm and more acidic than ever. Can anyone please relate with me and tell me that it‚Äôll all be fine. I don‚Äôt know if anyone can understand what I‚Äôm going through. Also if there‚Äôs a cure to stop all this? Please?üôè",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a quiet environment when laying down i can feel my heartbeat in the back of my head. i also feel a big lump in the back of my head. i also feel that stomach is bloated a lot only during this period. one of gp suggested its probably migraine and Solution i tried is to take ibuprofen everytime and sleep immediately. it helps after i wake up and pain subsides. I might have taken 30 tablets in 365 days which suggest i am having this on average once every few weeks. what is this migraine subtype called? and which doctor should i consult? this happens in midweek and i cant work 2-3 hrs in middle of the day affecting productivity.

I didn‚Äôt know why sometimes I would be going about my day, and suddenly not be able to see. It took me years to learn what it was. I was afraid to tell anyone, and kind of afraid I was dying. No, that‚Äôs not the right way to go about things, but I was a teenage girl and I was scared. At 21, I took a job with a commute, and I knew that if I ever got a headache on the road I‚Äôd be in trouble.

If I take my meds regularly (antihistamine plus my other meds that happen to end in mine) then I should avoid the worst of it.

"Do you have persistent, nagging headaches? Are they mainly located on the sides of the head? Have you tried so many neck treatments, medications or relaxation strategies but then never go away? ‚Ä¶.Well, your headaches may be caused by your jaw! You see the jaw which acts right on the head is highly rated with nerves that can produce headaches‚Ä¶ but also the muscles that move the jaw are attached to the side head. So it‚Äôs incredibly common to find that jaw dysfunction produces persistent headaches. Now before we know for sure, there are some questions that we can ask to give us a more accurate prediction of if it is actually coming from the TMJ. In this video. If you answer yes to three or more of the questions in this video (BTW each of the sub-parts in question #3 count as one question). So yes to ANY 3 of them means there is a very high likelihood that your headaches issues is actually a Jaw or TMJ issue!

"Hello all! Absolutely coming to this thread to see if anyone can put my symptoms together into something or if somehow I genuinely have a variety of issues that are separate. The biggest thing that started in 2019 was something my doctor called intensive hipnic jerks - so what happens is that in my sleep I wake up from that ‚Äúfalling feeling‚Äù but it‚Äôs extremely intense and comes with an immediate panic attack. From that point onward, I‚Äôm very disoriented, hyperventilating, anxious etc and every time I close my eyes it will start all over again. The worst case of this I was awake for four days and having hallucinations from sleep deprivation. This has continued on until present with very little solutions found - currently diagnosed with a panic disorder because of it. It only happens in my sleep or with my really bad migraines. It also has daytime anxiety for all the days it follows until it subsides. In addition to that, I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Asthma, I‚Äôve had migraines since I was 10 (anywhere from 2 hours to the longest one being 13 days). I‚Äôve been diagnosed with IBS and Interstitial Cystitis as well. I very regularly have pretty extreme bloating and never have regular *number twos* unless I take medication for it. This also usually comes with pretty painful abdominal pain. I do also experience pelvic pain most months. I have also been diagnosed as hypermobile in almost all of my joints and I wonder how much is connected to that. My doctor does say I have extra sensitive nerves and very regularly have whole limbs go to sleep very easily, including my right leg not working when my back pain flared up. The back pain theory so far is a slipped disk - xray booked for that I also very regularly have nightmares and used to have nightmares terrors from age two onward. I‚Äôm 29, white female, currently taking: - Sertraline - 75 mg daily - Hydroxyzine - 25-125 mg as needed for sleep and anxiety - Concerta - 27 mg for ADHD - Vitamin D supplement - Magnesium supplement - L-theanine as needed - Lorazepam 1mg as needed - Botox for migraines (hasn‚Äôt helped) I‚Äôm a registered psychotherapist myself, so as far as therapies go, I‚Äôve tried talk therapy, CBT, ACT, DBT skills, EMDR, IFS parts work, somatic work, and I‚Äôm about to try Neurofeedback therapy. I‚Äôve tried physio, acupuncture, massages, lidocaine injections, breast reduction surgery, Botox for migraines and in trap muscles, a whole host of migraine medications. I‚Äôve had the following tests done in the past 5 years and all came back normal unless stated otherwise. - Echocardiogram - ECG - EKG - Extensive testing with internal medicine - two week holter monitor - blood work of almost every type (about to do more) - celiac test was negative - inflammation markers are normal - Thyroid seems to be normal - CT scan was normal - Sleep study came back normal (we were unable to catch the hypnic jerks on the study) - had a gastrointestinal specialist - epilepsy and seizures testing I regularly work out with a blend of weight lifting, cardio, and HIIT. My doctor says my weight and eating is fine! None of my symptoms have ever seemingly been connected to weight or lifestyle in particular. I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke, I sometimes have some THC and CBD drinks for pain. I am so open to ANY ideas - it has been years of testing with so little answers and it just feels wild to think at least some of them are connected. Happy to answer any questions!!

"I take many medications every day.

It's all considered safe. My OB says managing my pain and thus blood pressure is more important than any small risk of complications. Plus, if I don't take my meds, I can't work a job or function as a human being. I did reduce my SSRI dose even though OB said it wasn't strictly necessary, as it's a newer generation of medication and I'm trying to be cautious.

"When you do get ahold of your Dr, let them know you have 15+ headache days a month and want to see a neurologist (or if your insurance allows you to make an appt without referral, find one and book an appt).

I was quite excited to be able to receive Tylenol to try. I've been using Tylenol as a pain reliever for many years as I've gotten headaches quite often since childhood. Tylenol is the one brand that has been consistent in providing relief. This Daytime Relief has added Caffeine which helps on days that I can't go take a nap because I have a headache or migraine. I always need coffee to jumpstart my day so this is an added boost in addition to relief.

"My (29M) girlfriend (26F) of three years is a wonderful girl. I actually plan on proposing for her birthday in the next few months, but there‚Äôs this one issue that has caused a little disturbance. Well, I mean it never was an issue. Until time has caused it to become an everyday issue. My gf ‚ÄúLynn‚Äù and I truly enjoy talking to each other. I am a lot more introverted than her. I enjoy conversation, but really only talk when conversation is initiated with people I don‚Äôt know. Lynn will talk to everybody about everything non stop. Which makes her a good familiar face to lots of people in our mutual friends, community, and other social events. I love that about her. But living with somebody who talks non stop has become emotionally draining. I work a job that is basically non-stop meetings and group efforts over 40 hours a week. Up to 60 some weeks. So I socialize with people all day. When I come home from work, I just want to lay down and decompress for a while. So I go home, kiss her hello, and walk into the other room to read or watch tv. Immediately, Lynn comes up to me and starts ranting or explaining vivid details about her job. Most of the time it‚Äôs not even an issue or a problem, it‚Äôs just describing her work day. Step for step. It goes something like this ‚ÄúSo today, we all had this customer who wanted this. I told them we could do it this way. But ____ came up, and we actually had to try something new. One of my other co workers actually did this today and we talked about _____‚Äù This goes on for maybe 30 min before I try desperately to take a shower and get a second alone. I love her so much, but I spend all day talking non stop and I can‚Äôt continue to talk, or actually LISTEN until I go to bed. What bothers me the most I think is the fact that she talks AT me rather than WITH me. After she talks about her job and she can see I‚Äôm physically uncomfortable, she will say ‚Äúok so how about your day babe?‚Äù I will say one thing. She will listen. Then continue to talk about her job. Or another story from 15 years ago that somehow relate. Then it will snowball into one story about another story and she doesn‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm listening. If I‚Äôm ok. I‚Äôve told her ‚Äúbabe I have a migraine. I can‚Äôt really contribute to this convo anymore‚Äù She will say ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm sorry babe. Need a Tylenol?‚Äù And then continue the chatter. Same when we go out with her friends. I can never get a word in because she will just talk about their funny memories, or talk about our funny stories without me getting a word in. Yes we will have good discussions. But sometimes, it‚Äôs just too much. I have heard every story about her life, her friends, her ‚Äúfun experiences‚Äù, beef between her softball team mates from middle school. And she will describe it in the worst way possible. Telling every detail of every sentence she says, so a simple 1 min story turns into almost an hour. I really never want to hurt her feelings because when it comes to social batteries, everybody is different. Sometimes when we are in the car together, that‚Äôs when it gets the worst and where I physically feel uncomfortable. Even if it‚Äôs running errands or driving to my parents house an hour away. I will get out of the car ride in almost a frantic run because I feel so suffocated. The other week, we took a road trip to visit her sister and her parents about 4 hours each way. I was exhausted and there was so much traffic. After the first two hours, I could not talk anymore. Or listen. It was non stop stories that ranged from her old neighbors dog, to her old co worker from 10 years ago. Every moment of silence after her 20 min talking I was so anxious. Because I knew I had about 10 seconds maybe 20 until it started again. It made me feel physically nauseous. It was already late at night, and I worked the whole day. So I may have come off a little rude or exhausted. She said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong? What‚Äôs with the attitude?‚Äù I said I had no attitude I just can‚Äôt engage in conversation now I‚Äôve had a long day. She said ok, And then started talking again within 10 min about something new. She will start the conversation off with something about me or my interests, and then it quickly snowballs into another story with somebody I don‚Äôt care about at all.

"I would encourage prioritizing seeing a headache specialist over everything. Since you have other nerve issues likely playing into this, you need to be proactive and have a comprehensive plan because allodynia/central sensitization leads to pain responses to basic things like breeze or fabric. Additionally, spend time learning about conditions of central sensitization because your other nerve issues likely are playing into it. (for instance: my allodynia is the result of having several conditions of central sensitization - migraine, fibromyalgia, IBS, etc). The only medication I've personally found to be helpful for my allodynia (and that only was my thermal allodynia, not my static allodynia) is intranasal toradol. I've never found a topical, etc that helps. Botox can dull it for a bit but it rages back. Meditation and biofeedback also have been helpful. When I regularly was doing biofeedback and meditation, my allodynia improved a lot. If you want to see a headache specialist or neurologist quickly (without insurance), I work for a virtual neuro clinic that requires no referral and is as affordable as possible without insurance (Neura Health). Our OOP prices are at least half of what a typical neurology appt would be OOP. We have both headache specialists and general neurology for other conditions like neuropathy, etc. Until you get insurance, I'm sure our providers would develop a treatment plan involving the most appropriate meds from Cost Plus.

I had to threaten my GP with medical negligence as I am over 30 with chronic migraines and never had an MRI! been on multiple medications with a change in symptoms at the beginning of the year.

"I use stations! I have a station in all my rest areas. At my desk, by the couch, and on my nightstand. Each station has everything I would need within arm's reach. So, nail clippers, scissors, USB-C cord, chap stick, eye drops, excedrin and motrin, an eye glass wipe. This way, I'm not taking something from its 'home' and forgetting to put it back, misplacing it. And I'm not putting off doing something I need to do, like clip a hang nail or take a painkiller, which can make these things worse if I don't handle it right away. -- I got this idea from HowtoADHD's YT. She talks about ""points of performance"" so, having things close to where you would use them. Her example was the kitchen, like keeping everything you need for coffee -- including spoons and things you'd find elsewhere in the kitchen -- by where you make your coffee. I saw this video long before I knew I had ADHD, and used it to adapt my spaces to what she described, so that I had stuff within reach of where I'd need them. Stations as an idea came up for me about a year or two ago, though, a bit after my diagnosis. I also keep a portable station for things I can't get duplicates of easily but also can lose if I'm not careful. It's my ADHD bag, and it has my migraine specs, a battery charger, some lotion, a silent fidget toy, a couple of pens, and a notebook (plus the things in my normal stations.)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Hello there, I‚Äôm new to the sub. How do I go about getting tested for EDS. Most doctors I speak to about it have either never heard of it or don‚Äôt take me seriously. I cant find much info online about EDS and only know about it through a friend who was diagnosed and my physical therapist who asked if I have it. I‚Äôm not sure how much of this is relevant so I‚Äôll just post some general info about my current conditions. I have severe arthritis and psoriasis. I‚Äôm anemic and hypoglycemic. If I stand up too fast I get lightheaded and blurred vision and have to sit for a while to regain my senses. I‚Äôm hypermobile and I can‚Äôt remember what my physical therapist called it but I have muscle issues and have constant knots in my back, neck, and shoulders. I have stretchy, elastic skin and my veins are all SUPER visible. Almost like my skin is translucent. I get infections easily (some of these symptoms could be because of the injections I take for my arthritis/psoriasis). I have almost constant fatigue/exhaustion. I‚Äôm regularly nauseous. I get headaches probably once a week and a migraine once a month or so. I bruise super easily. Having invisible disabilities is exhausting. But even more exhausting is dealing with doctors who either don‚Äôt care or aren‚Äôt qualified. I was misdiagnosed with my psoriasis 4 times before i found a real answer. 5 doctors couldn‚Äôt figure out what my thrush was until one finally decided to check the side effects of my medicine. I‚Äôve had 4 different rheumatologists and only my most recent one told me to go physical therapy for my hyper mobility, I had no idea the pain I was feeling wasn‚Äôt from my arthritis. I‚Äôm sorry for the long post and rant. I‚Äôm just exhausted. I‚Äôve also had a supposed ‚Äúcold‚Äù for two weeks now and I just wish someone would listen to me when I say that I know it‚Äôs not a cold and there‚Äôs something more going on.

"Daily was probably the wrong word to use. I can have migraines that last a few days and then start back up a day or two later.

"I'm going to give a bit of history and my symptoms before I go into what happened at my last GP appt in June. I was about 17 when I started to experience what I was told were migraines. Initially, it was suspected that my wisdom teeth were the source of the problem. However, do to my parents inability to communicate with me about how their dental insurance worked, I didn't get my wisdon teeth out until l was 22, which I paid for myself. I was told that once they were out my migraines would stop. Well, they didn't. Since then I've been prescribed many different migraine medications, medications that aren't for migraines, but has an affect on them, told to take supplements, a pain journal, etc. But the next visit it has been completely forgetten about and/or there isn't enough time to bring it up. In 2020, I was diagnosed with chronic migraines. I'm currently 33 (34 in two months). Would like to make note that I have technically two GPs as I was under the father care since i was three and a half and his daughter took over his practice in 2017, but he's only semi retired. The father as missed diagnosingme with ADHD and autism. My symptoms that had over the years with these migraines: -severe pain/pressure that it feels like my head is in a vice -as a kid, I described it was feeling like I'm under water. - brain fog to the pain its hard to speak/think/hold a converstion -unable to keep my eyes up too long because its too tiring to do so -passing out from the pain -nausea/vomiting (only do vomit now when its really bad) -sensitive to light/sound -mostly recently stabbing eye pain -stabbing pain in my temples -seeing auras -facial numbness/tingles The Doctor's Appointment: I have a doctors appoint early June inregards to having a migarine for two weeks straight. Nothing was helping with the pain. I tried to telling that father everything I could as he hadn't seen me in awhile and from the last visit I had with his daughter, it didn't seem that a). their records were up to date or b). they haven't been reading the records because when I spoke about some mental health struggles I was having, she said that people with bipolar... I stopped her and informed that the diagnosis had been changed by the psychiatrist in their team to ADHD (the daughter has even wrote me a script for Concerta) with autism and borderline. But what ended up happening was I talked over multiple times, informed that what I'm experiencing are not migraines, but medicine induced headaches because I will take two extra strength Tylenols and one Aleve together (daily: 2 Aleve and about 8 Tylenols) when they occur. Now, thats not the only thing I do, but that's all he allowed me to get out. I also will smoke certain strains of weed that have been proven to help with migraine pain and I find place a cool cloth at the base of neck and my forehead help as well, but I have two kids so I can only do certain things when they're not around. He ended up telling me that I can't take any pain meds for the next 3-4 months to flush everything put of my system since I've been taking too much meds, they built up, are at a toxic level and my body doesn't know how to deal with pain anymore since I take all these meds. He didn't do any blood tests or anything. He told me to get botox done and that I should apply to new doctor in my rural area to make things easier on myself. (Used to live in a meduim size city, move to a rural community 30 mins out for it) And that was pretty much the whole appointment. He gave a script with Medicine Induced Headaches on it to look up on my own time. I left there in tears as well. So, if you read this far, what can I do to get some sort help/relief.

"Here's some info about [sero-negative RA ](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/more-about/what-type-of-ra-do-you-have). It actually is rare, and estimated to be at most 20% of all RA dxs. Further, it's harder to dx because the rheumatologist needs to rely on patient reported symptoms instead of easily identifiable blood work. The best way to prepare for your appointment is to keep track of your symptoms. Here's a blurb about that: Keeping track of your symptoms is helpful to you and your physicians. Documenting your pain (aching, sharp, muscle spasms, etc), when it occurs, what you do to alleviate it (rest, cold, heat, meds), and what works best. Also include things that you might not think matter (headache or migraine, energy level, mood, how you're sleeping, gender affirming hormone therapy, if AFAB then hormonal fluctuations and symptoms, or if you're dealing with peri/menopause - any of those fun things). This is going to give your physician a quick, clear picture of your daily symptoms without having to remember them. It's also helpful to show if any meds are or aren't working. Sometimes meds work quickly, but a lot of RA meds take time to build up. It's not easy to know if you're a little bit better, but looking back over time can give you a more objective view of how you're doing. Medical appointments are very short, and sometimes we have MDs that aren't great at listening; this will really help with them. There are apps for this, but I'm happy using a school planner. I keep it on my dresser, and it's now a habit. It has helped me countless times, both for me to understand my own symptom changes and to communicate them clearly to my MDs. Even if you end up with a different dx, this is the best way to prepare and advocate for yourself. I know it's exhausting and frustrating to be waiting so long for a dx, but you're on the right track! You might not get an appointment for a while: in many parts of the country specialists are hard to see these days. You might want to talk to your GP about a Prednisone taper. It will tamp down symptoms and also inform your dx. If Prednisone works, and then symptoms return it indicates inflammation; this is frequently part of the diagnostic process.

"One simple way to test for these problems is: if you feel as if symptoms might be indicating a migraine is coming, try taking an over the counter H1 and H2 blocker (antihistamines).

"I'm not even sure what flair to give this. I'm feeling really desperate and really need support, as I'm the only person in my circle experiencing peri- and ADD. This is really long, but if anyone can help me, I'd really appreciate it. A couple years ago, I started having all the classic peri-menopause signs: irritable, anxious, headaches, brain fog, forgetfulness, dry skin, etc. Saw my Gyno, she suggested birth control pills. Got on them, got my first ever migraine with aura, and since my family has a history of stroke, I got off that real quick. Then she suggested an IUD, but all of the horror stories I've read about them made me nope out of that option. We settled on HRT - .05 patch and 200 mg progesterone. My monthly headaches went away, but 2 weeks before my period, my moods are severely ugly. I'm mean, angry, and really unpleasant. I hate myself. Since I was already taking Effexor (for about 7 years up to that point), my family practitioner increased the dosage on that, diagnosed me with PMDD. I maxed out on the Effexor. It worked for about 2 months at that dose. At that point, she suggested I see a psychiatrist to try to figure out a better anti-depressant, anti-anxiety med. Saw the psych, he almost immediately diagnosed me with ADD, had me taper off Effexor completely, gave me a 10 mg Prozac bridge, and started me on Vyvanse 20 mg for ADD. Vyvanse worked the first couple of days I took it - I felt clear-headed, was able to accomplish so much, my head was finally ""free"". Day 3 or 4, it worked great until about 6 hours after I took it. I'd crash with a headache, sleepiness, and a foul mood. He suggested upping the dose to 30 mg. Tried that, same deal. Only now, when I crash, I feel like my heart is racing and get that ""I can't breathe"" feeling I get with anxiety. I've tried taking L-Theanine and Magnesium to head off the headache (heh), but still not feeling my best. On top of everything, I'm really down, depressed, unhappy, and just want to be myself again. I could probably try another ADD drug. I could increase the Prozac. I had my testosterone and thyroid levels checked, and they're fine. Should I even bother my gyno with a request to increase estrogen or progesterone? Is that a thing? I'm only 49, I don't want to feel like this. Yes, I exercise, drink lots of water, eat plenty of protein, and take all kinds of other supplements.

"Hi all, if you are reading this I hope you are well. Context: I'm 28M, caucasian, european, 165cm or 5.4 feet, 75 kg, daily smoker and cannabis for 10 years, just quit recently out of the sudden after wanting to quit for a couple years now. Conditions: epidimical cyst for 10 years; migraine with aura (started 3 years ago, head CT scan clear, better with healthy food and no diary products); biopsed throat papilloma last year; cough suspect of acid reflux and of post nasal drip (nasal drip with blood 2 to 3 times per year). Overweight, sedentary, otherwise healthy. DISCLAIMER: I have health (cancer) anxiety because of losing my grandparents for cancer (breast; liver and lung) in the last 5 years and almost lost my mother to a huge meningioma and post-op complications early this year. Also anxiety for not being able to quit tobacco and cannabis. I don't expect any diagnosis from this post, this is me just letting it out from my chest and looking for possible orientation. Complaint: stomach area discomfort when sleeping on each side and on belly. Feel like a pin is being pressured in my stomach when sleeping, pain I would say 2/10, more like a pressure or discomfort. Sometimes it is a little stabbing, increasing its pain to 5/10 for a few seconds. During the day, I can feel 2 pea size lumps/nodules in the stomach area (upper left abdominal quadrant, just below the ribcage). They feel like it could be lymph nodes like the ones I feel in my neck, but I'm worried I have some underlying stomach condition. I rarely vomit, only when I have aura migraines, and more recently this vomit came with blood. My GP said it was not to worry if it is just sometimes and not regularly. I have spoken to my GP regarding a weird feeling in my chest area, just above this location in the ribcage, but I figured it was acid reflux because since I have stopped smoking and eating better, such feeling is less frequent and less intense. On the other hand, since I quit weed, my sleep is not so deep, so now I wake up during the night to change positions from one side to the other because I feel this complaint (stomach discomfort/pin being pressured in my stomach). When I was using weed, I wouldn't wake up during the night at all, but I would wake up kind of sore in the stomach in the morning, but disregarded it thinking it was just from sleeping on my belly. Now that I have discomfort/pressure while sleeping, I'm concerned if it is connected to the pea size bumps in the stomach. It sure feels so. Note: I don't have trouble swallowing, nausea, fever, I haven't lost weight, I use the bathroom just fine, I haven't lost my appetite - on contrary, I thought my appetite came from the weed but no, I eat a lot and thus feeling kind of full/bloated after eating. I will definitely tell my GP about this pea size lumps and discomfort when sleeping (he will probably just give me some medicine to sleep lol), but should I see a specialist as well? As I said, this pain doesn't leave me incapacitated and grabbing onto my belly, but is discomforting and ruining my sleep lately. If you read this far thank you for your time and if you care to help/guide on what to do it is much appreciated! TLDR: Stomach area discomfort when sleeping, feel like pin is being pressured in stomach, during the day can feel 2 pea size bumps in stomach, no real pain, just discomfort, specially when sleeping.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Hello, I am a 45 man and I have been at a loss for my symptoms that developed over 7 months ago. On the right back side of my head, one evening while out at Top Golf, I felt like something was crawling around inside of my skull for about 3 minutes. And every day since, I have had some sort of a headache. It is not a painful headache, but a headache that feels like pressure. About 3 weeks after this started, I was able to secure an appointment with a neurologist to have an MRI of the brain and nerve test. Nothing was found and the neurologist prescribed me the migraine medicine Qulipta. I refused to take it because I am not having migraines. I went to another my primary care physician, who performed a blood, urine, diabetes, kidney, and a plethora of other tests, including an additional MRI of the head and neck (with and without contrast). Again, nothing was found. He said I have a deviated septum, although I am not experiencing any of the symptoms. My breathing, congestion, etc. are fine. The doctor then felt like I was potentially developing high blood pressure so asked me to take my blood pressure whenever I was feeling the head pressure. My Blood pressure rendered normal. Through all of this, I still go to the gym, go running, walking, bowling, bike riding, function at work, etc. with no problem. So these ‚Äúheadaches‚Äù are not limiting my regular activities, just concerning. Every once in a while, I feel the pressure pinpointed on one spot of my head, and its intense for a few seconds then goes away. Other times, I feel the pressure over my whole head and feel the need to take a nap, and when I do, I wake up feeling much better. I halted all vitamin supplements I was taking and cleaned up my diet a little (I am a pescatarian). Additionally, I switched pillows and the way I sleep. Some nights are better than others. More recently, I have been waking up with light tingling on the right side of my head and neck, and I am starting to feel something off in my nasal cavity. Now I am even more lost at my symptoms as it feels like they are progressing. I am starting to think this could be Occipital Neuralgia (ON). Has anyone experiences anything similar?

Did that for 3 years and the migraines never stopped or decreased even a little bit.

I agree. Everyone is struggling and the ‚Äústruggle Olympics‚Äù as I call it is very unfair. It‚Äôs unfair to say your headache doesn‚Äôt hurt because it‚Äôs not a migraine.

"Hi all! I've been having issues with my migraines getting so bad these last few years that its not even funny. I can barely get out of bed most days because I'm so sleepy/drowsy. The migraines persist for DAYS! I can't even sleep well let alone feel refreshed because I wake up with my migraines! How do yall get through it? I've been putting off seeing a doctor for this for so long and I finally set an appointment up to see a migraine specialist, but I can't even see the doctor until January. How do you track your migraines and what over the counter medicine are yall using cause I've just been taking Tylenlol and it hasn't helped much. I even went to the ER a few months back for a crazy bad migraine and they gave me some meds but nothing worked. It just made me feel incredibly awful as if I had spiders all over my body and I just wanted to LEAVE. Like I was crying telling my husband how much I felt like leaving there because the meds they gave me, made me feel so freaked out. I have never felt like that. I literally felt like a drug addict. I was scratching my arms and like bouncing on the bed and couldnt sit still because of the meds. Not to mention the migraine was still there even after leaving the ER. It was so bad though, I was feverish and sweating like no tomorrow. Do you track your migraines? Do you use an app or hand write it? Wat do I need to be mindful of when tracking it? What are your triggers if you have any? I feel like I'm literally useless. I've had these migraines getting worse and worse ever since I got married 4 years ago. My husband is a trucker and I cant even keep the house clean while he is gone and I cant evem cook him a good meal when he is home or to pack food for him to take with him. When he is home, our intimate time is always difficult for me because of the migraines. Its like my head is being split in two 99% of the time. I genuinely cant remember the last time I didnt have a migraine. My husband takes care of all the bills, cooks and cleans the house when he is home, and he takes care of me when he is home. I feel like a burden on him and sometimes I feel like he could do better without me. I'm literally in bed like 99% of the time because I get super dizzy and because of this I have been ordering food from DoorDash often and as we all know it gets expensive. I feel like he thinks I'm lazy and I dont want to be like this anymore. I need some serious help, but I cant even see the doctor for another few months. How do yall even manage?? I barely even understand the different types of migraines.

"33F. I am beginning my journey of diagnosing (or ruling out) MS after experiencing symptoms that have worsened over the past 15+ years. After years of medical gaslighting - ""it's just anxiety, it's just hormones"", I'm finally feeling ready to take the plunge and meet with a neurologist and get a proper MRI. But knowing that I may also have to get a lumbar puncture (which is going to put me in some medical debt along with the MRI) to potentially get an accurate diagnosis has led me to start gaslighting myself. It's a big reason why I've been putting off seeing a specialist or pushing for more testing. I experience my symptoms and play them off as something else, ""maybe I'm just dehydrated"", ""maybe it's just because it's allergy season"", ""maybe it IS just anxiety"", and a million other reasons I try to talk myself out of spending the money on an MRI because of my fear I'll go into debt for nothing. But then there is the part of me, that when my symptoms worsen, I feel like it isn't all in my head that MS is possible. It feels so so likely. My first symptoms began at 16/17. I was experiencing severe fatigue, easily tired, and heat intolerance which led to headache and shortness of breath. I'd have periods where I'd get dizzy and disoriented, and 2 episodes of fainting within a month but was told it was just anxiety (I was also dx with neurocardiogenic syncope). I believe my next episode was likely in 2014/2015. I started experiencing some GI issues that seemed unprovoked, and suddenly I was experiencing frequent urination, urge to urinate immediately after emptying the bladder, and decreased libido. I was dx with overactive bladder and told the GI issues and low libido were just anxiety. Also during this time I started having frequent migraines and my vision just felt ""off"" at times, especially in hot environments. I experienced tingling in my fingers and toes for the first time, especially in extreme temperatures. 2016 - experienced my first ocular migraine. I only experience them 1-2 times every 4-5 months thankfully. During this time I was also noticing that my fatigue was continuing to worsen, especially in the heat. 2019 to present - all my prior symptoms seemed to ebb and flow. Sometimes they were bad and other times they were barely noticable. I'd go through periods of urinary frequency that made working and sleeping difficult, and within a week or two feel like I was back to baseline (still having some nocturia). I got kidney stones twice. My symptoms definitely appeared to worsen significantly in the heat - I feel pressure behind my eyes that makes my vision a little blurry temporarily, the fatigue is through the roof, I struggle to focus and get quickly irritable, muscle soreness, headache and shortness of breath. When I cool down the symptoms appear to resolve. The shortness of breath has started becoming a lot more frequent and there are times when I've needed to use a cane due to fatigue and dizziness. I'm feeling numbness in my left foot inconsistently (sometimes also the right but rarely), mild temor and weakness in right hand (very rarely in left), and my left knee becomes very stiff (painful when bending or going down stairs). Sharp burning pain in a very specific spot on my middle right back that comes and goes. Tinnitus is nearly constant since the past 7 months. Forgetfulness episodes are happening more often, forgetting words for things or whole phrases, which results in me feeling flustered. All of these symptoms seem to come in cycles, not always together, each cycle almost always seems to being a different combination of symptoms. I have so much more I want to say but I've already written a novel. If you've gotten this far, bless you. I guess I'm just wondering if I'm wasting my time and money seeking a MS diagnosis. But I'm exhausted of feeling this way. I want to go to the beach and not feel like I have the flu. I want to sleep through the night or make it through a work day without having to pee multiple times. I'd like to be able to go to the gym and exercise with friends without nearly passing out after some light exercise. I guess I just want an answer that confirms this isn't in my head. That after years of being told it's ""just anxiety"" or ""just hormones"", I was right that something else was causing this decreased quality of life.

"This is interesting. So I hadn‚Äôt drank any alcohol in like a year. I went to a fair and I was feeling great and thought, I‚Äôll have one beer. And wouldn‚Äôt you know it.

In my pained anxiety I decided to do a search and discover that beer actually causes an insane amount of histamine to flood the body.

"Slightly unethical life pro tip - insurance will rarely cover Botox for TMJ, but they *will* approve it for migraines. There are something like 30+ injection points for migraine Botox relief, and some of those points are around the jaw muscles. Probably isn‚Äôt relevant for OP, but for anyone reading this, it‚Äôs a bit of a work around as migraines and TMJ often go hand in hand. I got mine covered (my doctor submitted for migraines) and it ended up costing about 300 total (which included the 150 dollar injection fee from the dr) Obv won‚Äôt work for everyone, and I‚Äôm not sure how to do it without the patient already being part of a clinic that does Botox for pain relief, but it‚Äôs a possibility.

"My tale of woe: I saw a neurologist who diagnosed it. When I was a kid, I'd take the correct dose for my age. That seemed to not work so well, so I started taking more. I was up to 8 OTC strength ibuprofen with little effect on the headaches. When Excedrin became a thing, I never took too much like that. But the headache never quite went away. So I'd take the correct dose. For years, I was basically *giving* myself headaches. I had to do a migraine diet for 3 months (no citrus, no caffeine, no chocolate, no MSG, no cheese..). Then he said yep, it's Rebound. Put me on a daily anti-seizure med that can help with migraines, and once I did that for a while, I got switched to an as-needed med.

"i hear you!! i had milder acne but was very very nervous before starting!! i just finished & i can tell you aside from the dry lips and dry eyes (i wear contacts) all other symptoms were super manageable (i had some general body achiness & dry skin) and it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems! when you‚Äôre on accutane, really take it easy with other skincare products. definitely a calm face wash (i used cera ve), good moisturizer (yours is great!), and SPF. aside from that, i didn‚Äôt use any other products my entire journey. since being off ive started a vitamin c and will begin a retinol in a month or so to help with any remaining scarring. i was on 40mg first month, 60mg next 5 months. as far as your medications, speak to your dermatologist about when you should be taking each dose, and speak to your prescribing doctor for your other medication to make sure there aren‚Äôt any interactions (i take migraine meds and checked with my neurologist before starting). you can always give a quick google search of ‚Äúisotretinoin + amoxicillin interactions‚Äù but don‚Äôt fully depend on that. definitely speak to both prescribing doctors. good luck!! it goes by faster than u think!! u got this!!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How many weeks are you? Def call your OB for how to proceed, but I had chronic headaches and weekly migraines that would last 24-48hrs between weeks 5-9(ish).

"It's as the title states , my spoilt braty sister is 10 years old and turning 11 next month and she acts like a toddler having a huge temper tantrum when nothing goes her way, if you tell her no she screams/cries, she will literally mock you by repeating what you said whilst making faces at you, she destroys other people's things for example my mother's precious necklace, my notebooks I write in for uni, my clothes by wearing them and putting food stains/stretching them out because she is more of a bigger build (if you know what I mean), she destroyed my caps (type of hat) that I have a collection of from all my travels, she will sneeze/ cough in your face even when you tell her not to and to sneeze/ cough into her elbow, she will be petty and she shows no remorse for it. She is ignorant, rude, shelf centred Etc. The list goes on and on, but I hope that you get the picture. It's gotten to the point she literally walks all over my mother but the thing is my mother has always let her so that basically boosted the brats ego and is probably the way she is now, she back chats both my mother and father and currently right now she is in a lot of trouble over some other things but the thing is she sees it as "" oh I'm not in trouble, mum will ease up tomorrow"" and you know what she does and that is what makes me mad. She doesn't pay for her actions and basically gets a slap on the wrist (not literally, it's a metaphor or a thing we say in our country when someone gets let off the hook easily) I'm at my Witt's end with it all and I have been dealing with it for far too long. When I try to voice any of this to anyone outside of my family, they don't believe me at all and think I'm making it up. I flat out refuse to drive her anywhere in my car or take her with me grocery shopping as that's a total nightmare and the thing is she then complains to our mother and out mother ends up taking her side nearly nine times out of the ten. I'm not the only one she tries to get into trouble, the third youngest who will be 13 this year cops a fair bit of it as well and we are not sick of it at this point. And when I go to talk to the youngest she will blantonly ignore me or scream at me so loud the whole surrounding neighbourhood can hear her. So I have decided that I want nothing to do with her at all, I ignore her yelling and throwing a tantrum and basically distance myself from her altogether and that may seem harsh to some but I have had enough, she upsets me where she knows it hurts, she causes me stress to the point I get a migraine, I'm physically and mentally drained just from her doing all of that, that I don't want anything to do with her at all.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"My mom has suffered from migraines her whole life. In recent years they have increased in frequency with her experiencing an onset of symptoms (aura) every 1-2 weeks, with full migraines breaking through (i.e. rescue meds do not work) every 3-6 months. For her, the aura typically presents in the form of dizziness, difficulty speaking and visual blind spots. In the case her rescue medicine (Zavzpret nasal spray) does not work, a break-through migraine takes the form of severe head pain, confusion, sensitivity to light, aphasia and sometimes hallucinations that last about 24-72 hours where she is confined to bed. These episodes typically end with a trip to the ER on day 3 or 4 and needing a migraine cocktail. She takes Qulipta daily as her preventative and had been for about two years. Earlier this year she started seeing a new neurologist that recommended botox treatments. Her first injections took place in early May. On June 22nd she had a migraine break through. This one lasted 4-5 days and ended in the ER as usual. After this migraine on July 1st, her neurologist increased her Qulipta dose from 30mg to 60mg. Still experiencing weakness and shakiness, my mom decided to start a steroid on July 3rd (Which has helped in the past). Halfway through the steroid dose and about 10 days into the higher Qulipta dosage, she experienced a second migraine break through on July 10th. We cannot recall a time that she's ever had two migraines within such a short span of time. Today on July 27th, 17 days later, she has still not fully recovered from this migraine. Her aphasia symptoms have been improving in small increments each day, but have never persisted this long ever before. She still feels shaky and weak. Her 2nd set of botox injections are set for next week on August 2nd. We are on the fence as to whether to stick these out or not. We are worried the botox could be the reason for the increase in migraine frequency and worsening of symptoms, but we really have no idea. Her neurologist says that the botox is not the cause and that we should continue. Does anyone have any experience with botox injections - good or bad?

"Sorry about this wall of text. I've actually tried all of the CGRP meds, except the infusion one because that one can't be taken with Emgality (the one I'm on currently) and my neuro was concerned that if the infusion failed, I'd be in hell for 3 months while it left my system. I was lucky to get put on Aimovig almost immediately when it came out. But after a few years it was like my body got used to it. I was moved to Ajovy which I had a weird total body allergic reaction to. So now it's Emgality. I'm also asthmatic and allergic to way too much stuff, so I'm on quite a lot of allergy meds and some overlapping (with migraine) asthma meds. I'm on a blood pressure medicine specifically for my migraines. My second one because the first caused heart problems. I'm on zonisamide for migraines (off label use) and emgality. I have ubrelvy for abortive. I've tried the rest of the abortives, some did nothing, some bad such awful side effects (and such little migraine improvement) it wasn't really worth taking them. I've tried Topiramate. One made me so unable to think I bearly crashed my car twice in the weeks starting it and the other was tanking my kidneys. I've tried gabapentin, which made me so incredibly clumsy it was as if I couldn't even walk down stairs without incident. I've tried others, too many to recall.

"Longtime lurker using my husband's account to post! **Cycle:** 11 **Age + Partner's age (if relevant):** Both 32 **Typical cycle length:** 26 days (24-28 typical) **Ovulation cycle day:** CD11 **CD/DPO of positive test(s):** 11 dpo **CD/DPO of any negative test(s) before positive:** 7 dpo (I wanted to check before I went out for dinner/drinks with friends). **Tracking methods and app(s) used:** BBT, Fertility Friend, casual CM checking. **Relevant days of sperming and/or method (SMEP, TI, IUI, FET, etc.):** O-4, O-2, O, O+2 (we were aiming for SMEP this month but my OPKs were never blazing positives so we ended up with every other day). **Health conditions/medical tests:** follicular phase migraines for me, acid reflux for both of us. We did the standard fertility tests (SA, HSG, hormone tests) and they came back normal. **Supplements and medications (yours and/or your partner‚Äôs):** Mama's select prenatal (to avoid biotin, which breaks me out) or just 800 mcg folic acid when lazy for me. 200mg CoQ10 and Nordic Naturals fish oil for both of us (although my husband says he wasn't consistent lol) **Birth control history (if relevant):** birth control pill from 2009 to 2022 **Link to chart:** don't have a picture but my luteal phase was particularly saw toothed / jagged this month. I thought it was a bad sign but now I wonder if it reflected strong estrogen surges indicative of a strong corpus luteum (as per devbio) **Link to lineporn:** NA **Symptom Spotting:** after 11 cycles trying, I've had all the symptoms. This cycle didn't feel any different except that the sore boobs and elevated temp were still present on 11 dpo, which is when my BBT usually drops. I did have a migraine on 8 dpo but that's not unprecedented and may be due to trying soju the night before. The evening of 10 dpo I felt bloated but chalked it up to eating a lot of cheese - this persisted to the next day when I got my BFP. **Other (advice/tip(s), freaking out, miscellaneous):** I'm so sorry to say we were on a relaxing vacation for my luteal phase this cycle. I have to feel like that was a contributing factor.

"Hello and welcome to our Sub! I think the most important thing you can do to prepare for any medical appt is to track your symptoms. Here's a blurb about it: Keeping track of your symptoms is helpful to you and your physicians. Documenting your pain (aching, sharp, muscle spasms, etc), when it occurs, what you do to alleviate it (rest, cold, heat, meds), and what works best. Also include things that you might not think matter (headache or migraine, energy level, mood, how you're sleeping, gender affirming hormone therapy, if AFAB then hormonal fluctuations and symptoms, or if you're dealing with peri/menopause - any of those fun things). This is going to give your physician a quick, clear picture of your daily symptoms without having to remember them. It's also helpful to show if any meds are or aren't working. Sometimes meds work quickly, but a lot of RA meds take time to build up. It's not easy to know if you're a little bit better, but looking back over time can give you a more objective view of how you're doing. Medical appointments are very short, and sometimes we have MDs that aren't great at listening; this will really help with them. There are apps for this, but I'm happy using a school planner. I keep it on my dresser, and it's now a habit. It has helped me countless times, both for me to understand my own symptom changes and to communicate them clearly to my MDs. I also have RA (and OA) in my TMJs. Talk to your dentist about a night guard! Also get a face ice pack wrap (just search on Google or Amazon) and, if you don't already have one, a good blender. Sometimes all you can do is just rest your jaw, and smoothies (or frappes!) help immensely üòÅ",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"i recently started going to a chiro in my area. i‚Äôm not diagnosed with a specific migraine issue‚Äîsymptoms have been changing every 6 months. i was in constant pain for the last 3 years and april to end of june i was having a sinus headache and a tension headache at the same time. i couldn‚Äôt sleep unless i was basically embodying someone‚Äôs dad in a recliner swearing they weren‚Äôt going to sleep through a movie. laying entirely flat gave me an instant pressure increase in my head, every time i woke up i had a headache as if i had one glass of water for a week, and i felt like someone was punching me in the eyes every moment. a friend recommended a chiropractor in my area and she is great. her goal is to get me feeling better rather than coming back every week or so. i had a 8/10 migraine at the time of my first adjustment. i cannot stress enough the i n s t a n t pain relief i felt. 8/10 for me means i‚Äôm done i can‚Äôt move without extreme pain. the first pop to the right released nearly all sinus pain. i was then at a 7/10. the second pop to the left released the tightness in my neck and jaw. i have gone quite a few times now and i am able to hold my bones where they need to be. i do have back issues that we are currently addressing. i can sleep on my side again, i can sleep longer than 6 hours, i can properly move my head, i no longer feel like my head has extra fluid at the base of my skull, i only woke up once to a migraine bc of my cycle, and last week was my first full 7 days without a headache in 3 years. i feel like a whole new person. there are days where the pain comes back and it‚Äôs hard to work through and it may not work entirely for u but i would recommend trying.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"You might also find this interesting. Adhd people don't tend to form natural habits of patterns or routines. We have to think about it and each step every time. For example... nurotypical people? Like my husband. He has a morning routine. Gets up. Gets his coffee. Showers. Brushes his teeth. Kisses me goodbye. Feeds the cats. Grabs his keys, phone, wallet, bag, and then calls down the hall to say he loves me and locks the door before being off for his day. He naturally does all of this without a single thought about it. I wake up? I have to remember coffee exists. Question breakfast. Remember to brush my teeth, My hair, the steps of my make up. While I do the same things everyday too... I will forget parts of it or have to set things a certain way to naturally not forget them. Like my pills by the light switch to remember to take them. I have no set time because every day is a mystery of my brain function of remember to do the same steps I've done everyday for years. There is no ""I just do it. I don't think about it."" For adhd people. We have to make conscious effort to do anything. ...And if I miss a step of something new? Like I forgot to take my migraine prevention pills? I will literally forget they exist.

He also seems to get Nauseous ESPECIALLY if he eats before. Even if its a few hours before but that has gone away every time with a little zofran.

With mine my vision is slurred and everything that emits light will streak, I get agitated and struggle with memory, I get vertigo and dizzy with nausea, it feels like someone is stabbing a saw into my head and every sound and light makes it grind harder. When I have a migraine I'm prone to falling, cannot drive, and struggle to walk"". And many people are suprised when I say this and sometimes ask me if it's really migraine or another neurological issue. Migraine can happen with or without pain. Migraine may or may not distort vision. Migraine isnt a headache, it is a brain ""oopsie"" that can lead to incredibly variable symptoms and results. Even some doctors think migraine must involve a headache and a severe one at that. I know that every chronic illness has its own level of misunderstanding from the general public. But I do very much long for the day when people dont self-diagnose their bad headache as a migraine.

"Not really. There‚Äôs basically no risk with the plaster. I mean, an extremely small risk (much smaller than with pills) but so small as to not matter at all except if you have a diagnosed clotting disorder. Here are bad things about estrogen in pills that transdermal estrogen doesn‚Äôt have: pills have: 1. ‚Å†‚Å†increased risk of blood clots (very small risk for those who are younger so this isn‚Äôt a huge concern) 2. ‚Å†‚Å†increased risk of stroke (again, risk very small so don‚Äôt worry about this one too much if young unless you have preexisting issues like existing clotting or stroke risks or history) 3. ‚Å†‚Å†increased risk of gall bladder problems 4. ‚Å†‚Å†increased risk of cardiovascular negatives 5. ‚Å†‚Å†increased risk of migraines IF you‚Äôre susceptible to them, due to oral estrogen dumping all the E into your system at once, while patches give you a steady dose 24/7 6. ‚Å†Contraindicated if you have migraine with aura due to stroke risk. Transdermal is OK though. 7. ‚Å†mostly a different kind of estrogen if you care about that kind of thing. Patches are estradiol, the main ovarian estrogen, the main estrogen your body has before menopause. It‚Äôs more powerful than most other types. Birth control pills are ethinyl estradiol, which has a long half-life (estradiol has a short half-life). Hormone replacement has various different kinds of estrogen but a lot of it is converted into estrone in the liver. Estrone is the main post-menopausal estrogen released by body fat. It‚Äôs a weaker estrogen than estradiol. None of this may matter if you don‚Äôt care about it. Some people are very particular about it as it feels different and has different side effects. 8. ‚Å†‚Å†risk of lowering availability of thyroid hormones if you already have thyroid issues 9. ‚Å†‚Å†will lower your available testosterone, which can affect libido",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Not looking for a sleep aid so I don't need all the *other* ingredients I keep finding blended with it, though given Chamomile's own relaxing properties finding what I'm looking for is still easier said than done. What I'm looking for is a pocket friendly, ""wandering around at my retail job"" friendly way to use chamomile for its properties in both migraine treatment and heartburn relief. Preferably in a ""take as needed"" form rather than something I take once a day and hope it staves off the symptoms for the next 24 hours. Reason I'm interested in a gummy in particular is because I have a hyperactive gag reflex. I can usually swallow pills without trouble as long as I've got something to drink, but I've never been able to dry swallow and sometimes even *with* a drink any size pill will feel like I'm choking it down rather than swallowing it. (And trying not to vomit it back up before I've finally swallowed it.) Not too keen on the lozenge idea because keeping something in my mouth until it's dissolved can also trigger the reflex (I can't chew gum any more for this same reason, while at least a gummy is only in my mouth until I've chewed it down to size), but the act of sucking on one, I believe due to saliva production, does seem to help with heartburn as well. I've looked at tinctures as an option but I'd need to consider the alcohol free variations... can't stand the taste of alcohol so even if there isn't much in it that won't be very good for my gag reflex either unless it's totally undetectable. I'm currently trying Iberogast which is... not cheap. Not the most expensive thing out there but if it does end up being helpful I'll be hoping that their ""proprietary blend"" becomes available in a store brand *soon*. But I also question its effectiveness for heartburn for the simple fact that one of its ingredients is peppermint... which I like the scent of for my migraines but which can make heartburn worse due to it relaxing the wrong things....",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Quick background, i'm 36M, had TBI when I was 8 years old. I can't go out without atlius tinted contact lenses, tinted glasses, clip-on sunglasses, and a hat, whether it's day or night. Botox seems to be the only thing that works for me, but after 3 years, it only works for about a month and a half. The other month and a half, I'm on average 2 or 3 out of 10, i can go a week without leaving the house, I can't even go to my mailbox. I've tried numerous products that might help, and I'd say about 95% of them were failures. My wife told me about a product she saw on Instagram called ZOK Instant Migraine Relief. I was hesitant to try it because most of these are posted to get a free product and they sure don't post the negative ones. However, I decided to give it a try. I experienced great relief when I applied negative pressure to my left ear. It made me wonder if it could be related to vertigo, as neurologists never mentioned it. So, I looked into the vertigo Epley maneuver, which involves at home movements that provide relief from vertigo symptoms. When I tried it, i went from being miserable 2/10 to 8/10 in just 4 minutes, and I had a fantastic day, which is not something I'm accustomed to. Later that night, when I felt the headaches returning, I repeated the maneuver and felt great again. Yesterday, I smoked some weed, which usually results in extreme headaches for me in the following days. However, after doing the maneuver, the headache disappeared once more. I am amazed and can't believe that I have found something that makes me feel better by moving for 4 minutes I've done it 2 times today and each time it makes my brain function. This is the Epley maneuver, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SLm76jQg3g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SLm76jQg3g) Has anyone else had a similar experience with vertigo after TBI, and were you completely cured?",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The cure for that is to never get married. (j/k) I've had all types of headaches in my life, including a wife and two children. (OK, I'll be serious now) The medical term for headache is migraine. Some people think there is a difference, but typically people misuse the term ""headache"" to refer to a wide variety of migraines. And the problem is that an ""annoying"" migraine can be the warning shot. Having that ""annoying"" headache can tell you that you're going to be projectile vomiting / dry heaves soon. It was terrible timing that when I was suffering my worst migraines was when I had two children below the age of 3. During some of my migraine attacks, it would have been physically impossible for me to do anything at all to care for either of my children. When you are bent over the porcelain throne with uncontrollable dry heaves for 15 minutes (making it nearly impossible to breathe, by the way), it's not going to matter much if baby is screaming at the top of her lungs. But before a migraine gets nearly that bad, I would often have what I would describe as an ""annoying"" headache. It was annoying for two reasons. One, while it didn't stop me from doing anything, it did make me want to do nothing at all. Second, when I felt this way, I knew I was in for a very VERY bad day. Anyway, when I had what would be described as an ""annoying"" headache, it would have been very irresponsible for my wife to take off and leave kiddos to my care alone. Because for me, that was the warning that I would be totally incapacitated soon. It would have been dangerous for the babies to leave them in my care for the simple reason that I knew I (soon) wouldn't even be able to care for myself. It took doctors a while to get my migraines under control. Over the years I took various prescription meds including antidepressants and (beta blockers?, from memory). And I eventually grew out of my migraine phase to the point where I was neither taking migraine prevention medicine NOR was I suffering from migraines. I know it's fashionable to beat up men for being lazy fathers. I get it. But depending on how severe a migraine is, it could entirely justify leaving kiddo to be cared for by the parent who is not suffering from migraines.

"Hi! My neuro was happy to have me try Frova, but unfortunately, it didn't help my pain at all, so it wasn't a great option for me. It literally didn't even touch my pain - it was so weird. But, I know everyone reacts differently to all the triptans, so I think it's definitely worth trying. I've basically just stuck with triptans, Excedrin Migraine (which always works for me in a pinch on days when I've already taken my allotted triptans for the week), and also the migraine supplements (CoQ10, Magnesium, Riboflavin). The supplements have helped to reduce the number of migraine attacks I get each month, which has been great because whenever I've tried more natural remedies for anything, they have never worked for me üòÇ But these did. I started to notice my migraines getting better after about 3-4 months of consistently taking the supplements.

"I'm so sorry you had to go through this. Sounds so frustrating and familiar. Ugh. I'm also very sensitive to smell, before a migraine. WITH a 10/10 migraine, that's actual torture so I totally get you. Migraines have taught me how deeply important it is to self advocate because of how invisible they are. Suffering in immense pain no one else understands is debilitating in itself, especially when you're at the hospital and they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off. In my experience, they honestly don't know how to treat a 10/10 migraine. I've been to ER maybe 4-5 times for a 10/10 or red migraine as my neurologist calls it, and their treatment changes every time. I've been given migraine cocktails a few times, and the more recent times it's just sumatriptan which I already have a prescription for. In Ontario, they go by the ""migraine guidelines"" which changed recently. Honestly they're useless with migraines. I've learned their routine with ER screening and now get ahead of them, telling them all the tests, doctors, medications I'm on just to not waste my/their time. Believe it or not, the last two times the doctor actually said ""so what do you want to do?"" !!?? LIKE WHAT DO YOU MEAN???? You're the doctors! I need pain relief now!!!! Omg. These days I stay home because I couldn't bother, the fluorescent lights, annoying people, lack of knowledge and help all to be sent home with the same migraine. I think it's a very shared experience we all have where the ER makes us feel gaslit, doesn't help, sends us home and we're left in the same if not worse place then before.

"The weather here lately has been causing absolute havoc for a lot of people's heads, and I wanted to share how we found some relief. Fyi I'm not a doctor, but we just solved this for my girlfriend. At least as far as treating the symptoms. This is not medical advice, talk to your doctor if needed and do your own research about drug interactions etc. She suffers these migraines as a result of the pressure changes and subsequent swelling of nasal passageways/valves in her sinuses. The past several weeks here in Toronto have been hell on earth for her. She described to me how her symptoms feel and I realized how similar it was to my chronic sinus infections. How I could get relief with a specific nasal spray. Here in Canada the brand I found is Drixoral Nasal Congestion. The key ingredient is oxymetazoline, it shrinks the blood vessels and tissue in the sinuses and lets your head and sinus finally feel a sense of pressure relief. In the USA the same stuff is Vicks Sinex, again look for the oxymetazoline ingredient. Some nasal sprays contain other pain medicine like acetaminophen, so watch out for doubling up on that if you already take other pain killers. This is over the counter stuff, easy to get from most stores. Please read the dosing instructions carefully, you can't use this stuff for more than 3 days at a time, and it has dosage limits even inside of 12 and 24 hours. Its powerful stuff. If you do a little googling you'll find that it's most effective if you use it when you wake up with a migraine, as it will help stop the symptoms and swelling before it really gets cooking. That said, my girlfriend used it last night for the first time and woke up without a migraine for the first time in a while, so it might still work for you regardless. Again, this is not medical advice. I'm just trying to give a psa for people who might need help. This is a product marketed for sinus problems and decongestion, not necessarily migraines. But, if you get air pressure related headaches that radiate from behind the eyes and sinuses, I really hope this can help you find relief. Although this can only be used for very short dosages and periods of time, I think it can help break the cycle of swelling and help keep you from being in an endless cycle of migraines. p.s. I tried to post about this in r/Toronto because I've seen so many people commiserating about their migraines there, but one of the mods argued with me that it's not about Toronto and threatened to ban me. So here I am. I hope this post helps some people.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

"Hello! It‚Äôs been ten years that I‚Äôve been dealing with migraines and honestly I think I‚Äôve came a long way to handle it. Up to a point where at times I consider it somewhat useful, like a physical heads-up that I‚Äôve been pushing too hard lately. It keeps me motivated to be gentle on my body. Howeveeeeeer, I dislike the visual aura that I always get. Starts with flashy spots, difficulties to focus and an odd visual feel. Progresses towards losing my whole peripheral vision and more spread out ‚Äúwebs‚Äù of flashy and sparkly areas, essentially partially blind. As soon as it cools down almost immediately the pain comes through. I think keeping the cool and being calm helps big time, I don‚Äôt feel any anxiety about it anymore and it truly helps a lot. I just get bored that I have to endure to visual altercations for an hour or so. Also to have to take that in consideration for everything since it happens so often (like once a week in average). I‚Äôve recently began to wonder if there‚Äôs any trick and any ‚Äúworks for me‚Äù sort of thing that I could try on, to speed it up and cool it down. The way that I‚Äôve learned how to deal with the migraine makes me consider that there‚Äôs still a bunch to learn. Like back in the day I wouldn‚Äôt be able to read at all and nowadays I kinda still can despite everything else staying almost the same. PS: I guess I should state that most often my migraine pain isn‚Äôt super high and I have a pretty good pain resistance, I almost never take pain killers.

"Hi all. About a year ago, I started having heart palpitations. I went through the entire heart monitor routine for 2 weeks. Came back clean. Ultrasound looks great, tested negative for h pylori and gluten allergy. I tried pantoprazole and omeprazole in the past, but I would get massive day long headaches from them. I got into meal prepping and running, and my gerd/reflux symptoms are pretty much nonexistent if I stick to that. But if I start skipping workouts, or eating some spicy things, I‚Äôm back at it. My concern though, is these tension headaches. I get them pretty regularly, and it seems to be unaffected by diet. Tried going without caffeine for a week and no change. Today, I woke up with a headache and some reflux symptoms. Took some Pepcid, drank a lot of water, headache was unchanged but the reflux seemed to calm down. Then, I started feeling slightly sore in the throat. Then, the lingering headache changed to an intense almost migraine pain for about 5 seconds. Heart rate shot up to 145. Then it went back down to resting 65ish. Has anyone else had these before? At first, I thought they were anxiety induced because I was going through a lot of stressful events around the first one. They used to be pretty severe (ended up going to the ER for two of them after my heart rate kept staying around 130-170 for 10 minutes) but they‚Äôve slowly tapered down.

"I've been suffering from debilitating migraines for a long time, and it's been incredibly challenging to manage. The pain can be unbearable, and the only relief I find is through taking diclofenac potassium. However, my doctors don't seem to take my condition seriously. They keep prescribing medications like Ponstan, which barely help with a toothache, let alone a severe migraine. On top of that, my mother accuses me of being addicted to diclofenac and claims that my migraines are just a false sign of addiction. She believes I should simply stop taking this medication, but every time I try to stop, the pain becomes so severe that I end up having to be taken to the hospital. I'm at my wit's end with feeling dismissed by healthcare professionals and unsupported by those around me. It's incredibly isolating and frustrating. Has anyone else experienced something similar?

"I'm sorry you're dealing with this, I do understand how debilitating a daily headache can be. Whenever I see a post about this particular problem, I share my experience in case it might possibly help someone else. Years ago I was formally diagnosed with Chronic Daily Headache. This was in addition to frequent migraines. The daily headache was not a migraine, but it was painful and added a lot of stress to my life. The medication that completely eliminated the daily headache for me was mirtazapine. I took it for apprx. three years, and after I stopped, the daily headaches never came back. It didn't really help with migraines, though. I use separate meds for those. I will note that this med would cause me to strongly crave sweets and carbs after I took my dose at night, and that was hard to resist. I did put on a few pounds. But over time, with effort, I trained myself to ignore that urge as much as possible, and I maintained my weight from there. For me, the relief from the daily headache was worth the cravings that came with it. It was a side effect I was willing to learn to live with as the daily headaches were just brutal to keep enduring.

"Hey OP, I know this post is old, but I wanted to reach out and ask you how you are doing and if you figured out any more about your VM vs autistic burnout question? I have been dealing with VM on a daily basis since early January this year. This is the third period in my life dealing with daily fluctuating VM symptoms. I have had this previously, but it did manage to deal and it became more like episodic migraine for long periods. I don‚Äôt really get headaches, but I get all the usual light & sound sensitivity, dizziness, pattern sensitivity, screen & busy environment sensitivity, fatigue, realisation, and major brain fog. I have recently realised that I may be autistic. I am a 41 year old woman and probably highly masked. My experience with migraine this year has helped me realise that I have huge sensory issues that I‚Äôve been ignoring my whole life, I‚Äôm still unraveling it all. I have identified as a highly sensitive person for the last decade, only to realise lately that the general thought on HSP these days is that it is simply autism. Tonight I was reading a bit about autistic burnout, and it hit me like a brick that the symptoms sound so incredibly similar to vestibular migraine. Like crazy similar. I feel like I‚Äôm making a huge breakthrough in understanding myself. Do I have a constant migraine, or am I experiencing burnout that is manifesting as a migraine?? Are they both the same thing?? Or are they just very linked? I have been doing vestibular rehabilitation therapy to help with my ability to use screens, and I think I will bring this up to my vestibular therapist to see if they have any knowledge about this. I know I just wrote a huge comment about myself here, I just really wanted to show how I have come to start thinking along the same lines as you. I would be extremely interested to see what your thoughts are on this so many months later. Did you ever get to talk to any of your doctors about it?

"I‚Äôm 25. And I‚Äôve been dealing with super painful periods since my very first period (13 yrs). When I was 14 or 15 I was put on consistent birth control to stop the periods bc they would last for 7 days and they were heavy and I could barely function. That worked for a while until I was 20 when I formed a cyst on my fallopian tube. The tube, with the cyst, then wrapped itself around my left ovary essentially killing half of it. The tube and cyst had to be removed bc I started bleeding for two months straight. I‚Äôve been through hormone therapy, biopsies, I don‚Äôt have endometriosis. I‚Äôve been tested for pcos. And I had a dr tell me I was fishing for narcotics(I work in law enforcement so it was funny). I finally had a Dr tell me do whatever works. So, I‚Äôm on the generic Nuvaring. I just leave it in and skip my period. I had a mishap and it broke. In half inside of me. I had to take it out and this period is awful. I‚Äôm passing huge clots. I‚Äôm doubled over, I‚Äôm nauseous, I have a migraine. The pain is primarily on the left side but that ovary doesn‚Äôt even work. I can barely eat anything. And I‚Äôm taking tramadol and it‚Äôs not working. I have passed two kidney stones at once and this pain is comparable to the kidney stones. When I have a bowel movement it hurts so bad.

"I've had botox for migraines. In order to get them you need a referral to a neurologist and then they have to give you MRI to make sure theres nothing abnormal causing the migraines then you have to try at least two other medications and physical therapy to be approved for it. The shots themselves are painful as hell. They give you 31 shots across your forehead neck, and scalp. They are supposed to last at least 4 to 8 weeks but you cant get them again for 12 weeks. And when they wear off the migraines you get are ten times worse. If you are a daily migraine sufferer you might think 4 weeks without one is worth it but the one you get afterwards cant be cured by anything over the counter. Your eye feels like its falling out of your head and you may end up with muscle degeneration or what I call Picasso Face. My next treatment was cervical steroid nerve injections in my neck.
